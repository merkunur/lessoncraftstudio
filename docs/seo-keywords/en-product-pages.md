## Cannibalization Resolution Verification

All 6 cannibalization groups identified in the Part 1 audit are resolved:

### Group 1: "addition worksheets" — RESOLVED

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `addition-worksheets` | addition worksheets | addition worksheet generator | Rule 2 |
| `code-addition-worksheets` | addition worksheets | picture addition worksheet maker | Rule 2 + Rule 8 |

**Resolution:** Different action modifiers (generator vs maker) + "picture" qualifier on code-addition. Zero keyword overlap.

### Group 2: "free worksheet" (generic) — RESOLVED

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `alphabet-train-worksheets` | free worksheet | alphabet train worksheet generator | Rule 2 + Rule 7 |
| `big-small-worksheets` | free worksheet | big and small worksheet maker | Rule 2 + Rule 7 |

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `math-worksheets` | math worksheets | math worksheet generator with pictures | Rule 2 |
| Category hub `/math` | math worksheets | math worksheet generators for teachers | Rule 6 |

**Resolution:** Product page adds feature qualifier "with pictures"; category hub adds audience qualifier "for teachers". Different intent plus different qualifier.

### Group 6: "pattern worksheets" — RESOLVED

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `pattern-worksheets` | pattern worksheets | pattern recognition worksheet maker | Rule 2 |
| `pattern-train-worksheets` | pattern worksheets | pattern train worksheet generator | Rule 2 + Rule 8 |
