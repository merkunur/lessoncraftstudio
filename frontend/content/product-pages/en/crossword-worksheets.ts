        question: 'How Do Crossword Worksheets Compare to Word Search Worksheets?',
        answer: 'Crossword worksheets require active spelling and word construction while word searches require visual scanning and word recognition.

        question: 'Can Students Self-Check Their Crossword Answers?',
        answer: 'The interlocking grid format provides built-in self-checking. When crossing words share the same letter in an intersection square, students verify their answers match.
