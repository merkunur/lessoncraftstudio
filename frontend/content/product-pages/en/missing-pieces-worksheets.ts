          answer: 'A missing pieces worksheet shows an image with one or more sections removed. Below the image, students see multiple options and must identify which piece correctly fills each gap. It develops visual discrimination and spatial reasoning skills.',

          question: 'How many pieces can be removed from an image?',
          answer: 'You can remove between 1 and 5 pieces from each image. Removing just 1 piece is easiest for young learners, while removing 5 pieces creates a challenging puzzle that requires careful observation of multiple areas simultaneously.',

          question: 'How many answer options appear below each puzzle?',

          question: 'How do missing pieces worksheets develop cognitive skills?',
