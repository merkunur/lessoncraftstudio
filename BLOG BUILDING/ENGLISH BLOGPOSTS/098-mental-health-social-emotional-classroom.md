## Introduction: Addressing Student Mental Health

**Rising concern**: Student mental health challenges post-pandemic

**Statistics** (CDC, 2022):
```
Students reporting:
- Persistent sadness: 42%
- Anxiety: 37%
- Poor mental health affecting schoolwork: 22%

Teacher observation:
- Emotional outbursts increased
- Focus/attention decreased
- Motivation challenges common
```

**Academic impact**: Can't learn if emotionally dysregulated
```
Student experiencing anxiety:
- Fight-or-flight response activated
- Prefrontal cortex (learning center) offline
- Can't focus on math lesson (survival mode active)

Result: Mental health directly impacts academic performance
```

**Research** (Durlak et al., 2011): SEL programs improve achievement **11 percentile points** AND reduce emotional distress

**Key principle**: Address emotional needs to unlock academic potential (whole-child approach)
