## Introduction: The RTI Framework

**Response to Intervention**: Three-tier system for early identification and support

**RTI Tiers** (NCRTI, 2010):
```
Tier 1: Core instruction (all students)
- 80% of students succeed with quality first teaching
- Universal screening 3× per year
- Differentiated classroom instruction

Tier 2: Targeted interventions (struggling students)
- 15% of students need additional support
- Small group instruction (3-5 students)
- Progress monitoring every 2 weeks
- 20-30 min sessions, 3-4× per week

Tier 3: Intensive interventions (significant needs)
- 5% of students need intensive support
- Individual or very small group (1-2 students)
- Progress monitoring weekly
- 30-45 min sessions, daily

Movement: Data-driven (students move between tiers based on response)
```

**Research** (Fuchs & Fuchs, 2006): RTI reduces special education referrals **40-50%** (early intervention prevents failure)

**Key principle**: Intervene early with targeted, intensive support

---

## Universal Screening (Tier 1)

**Identify at-risk students before they fall too far behind**

### Fall Screening (September)

**Reading screening**:
```
Assessment: Oral reading fluency + comprehension
Benchmark: 3rd grade = 60-80 words per minute (WPM)

Results:
Green (60-100 WPM): 24 students (Tier 1 only)
Yellow (40-59 WPM): 5 students (monitor, possible Tier 2)
Red (<40 WPM): 1 student (immediate Tier 2)

Action:
- Green: Continue core instruction
- Yellow: Watch closely, check mid-semester
- Red: Start Tier 2 interventions immediately
```

**Math screening**:
```
Assessment: 20-problem grade-level worksheet (computation + word problems)
Benchmark: 3rd grade = 80% accuracy

Results:
Green (80-100%): 22 students
Yellow (60-79%): 6 students
Red (<60%): 2 students

Action: Target specific skills for Yellow/Red students
```

**Worksheet use**: Screening worksheets generated in 42 seconds (grade-level problems), scored quickly

---

## Tier 2: Targeted Group Interventions

**Small group instruction addressing specific skill deficits**

### Progress Monitoring System

**Example: Reading fluency intervention**

**Student**: Maria (3rd grade, reading at 35 WPM, below benchmark of 60 WPM)

**Intervention plan**:
```
Duration: 8 weeks
Frequency: 4 times per week, 25 minutes per session
Group size: 3 students (all reading 30-40 WPM)
Focus: Phonics patterns, fluency practice, comprehension

Weekly structure:
Monday/Wednesday: Phonics patterns worksheets (targeted practice)
Tuesday/Thursday: Fluency passages (timed reading practice)
Friday: Progress monitoring (1-minute oral reading assessment)

Materials needed:
- 32 phonics worksheets (8 weeks × 4 per week)
- 32 fluency passages
- 8 progress monitoring probes

Generation time: 72 worksheets × 42 sec = 3,024 sec (50 minutes for 8-week program)
```

**Progress monitoring chart**:
```
Week 1: 35 WPM
Week 2: 38 WPM (+3)
Week 3: 41 WPM (+3)
Week 4: 43 WPM (+2)
Week 5: 47 WPM (+4)
Week 6: 50 WPM (+3)
Week 7: 53 WPM (+3)
Week 8: 57 WPM (+4)

Growth: 22 WPM in 8 weeks (adequate progress)
Decision: Continue Tier 2 another 4 weeks (goal: reach 60 WPM benchmark)
```

---

### Math Intervention Groups

**Example: Fact fluency deficits**

**Students**: 4 third-graders struggling with multiplication facts

**Intervention**:
```
Target: Master 2× through 5× tables (foundational facts)
Duration: 6 weeks
Frequency: 3× per week, 20 minutes
Strategy: Concrete-Representational-Abstract progression

Week 1-2 (Concrete):
- Use manipulatives (arrays with counters)
- Build arrays, count total
- Worksheet: Draw arrays, write equations

Week 3-4 (Representational):
- Visual arrays on worksheets (pictures)
- Skip-counting practice
- Worksheet: Circle groups, skip-count

Week 5-6 (Abstract):
- Number fact practice (no pictures)
- Timed drills (1 minute)
- Worksheet: 20 facts, track speed and accuracy

Progress monitoring: Weekly 1-minute timed probe (how many facts correct)
```

**Growth tracking**:
```
Student A: Week 1 = 8 facts → Week 6 = 25 facts (+17, meets goal)
Student B: Week 1 = 5 facts → Week 6 = 18 facts (+13, close to goal)
Student C: Week 1 = 10 facts → Week 6 = 28 facts (+18, exceeds goal)
Student D: Week 1 = 6 facts → Week 6 = 12 facts (+6, needs Tier 3)

Decisions:
- Students A, B, C: Exit to Tier 1 (sufficient progress)
- Student D: Escalate to Tier 3 (insufficient response)
```

## Tier 3: Intensive Individual Interventions

**Most intensive support for students not responding to Tier 2**

### Individualized Intervention Plan

**Student**: David (4th grade, reading at 1st grade level despite Tier 2)

**Assessment results**:
```
Decoding: Can read CVC words (cat, dog), struggles with blends (trip, flat)
Fluency: 20 WPM (benchmark = 90 WPM)
Comprehension: Poor (can't understand grade-level texts)
Root cause: Weak phonics foundation (missing blends, digraphs)
```

**Tier 3 plan**:
```
Frequency: Daily, 45 minutes (1-on-1 with interventionist)
Duration: 12 weeks minimum
Focus: Systematic phonics instruction (Orton-Gillingham approach)

Daily structure:
15 min: Phonics patterns (explicit instruction + worksheet practice)
15 min: Decodable text reading (controlled vocabulary)
15 min: Fluency building (repeated reading of passages)

Worksheets needed:
- 60 phonics pattern worksheets (12 weeks × 5 per week)
- 60 decodable passages
- 12 weekly progress monitoring probes

Generation: 132 materials × 42 sec = 5,544 sec (92 minutes for 12-week program)
```

**Weekly progress monitoring**:
```
Week 1: 20 WPM, 60% accuracy on blends
Week 3: 25 WPM, 70% accuracy
Week 6: 32 WPM, 80% accuracy
Week 9: 40 WPM, 85% accuracy
Week 12: 48 WPM, 90% accuracy

Growth: 28 WPM in 12 weeks (strong progress)
Decision: Continue Tier 3 (still below benchmark, but responding well)
```

## Diagnostic Assessment

**Pinpoint exactly what skills are missing**

### Error Analysis Process

**Example: Math subtraction errors**

**Student worksheet review** (20 subtraction problems):
```
Correct: 12 problems (60%)
Incorrect: 8 problems (40%)

Error pattern analysis:
45    72    91    83
-23   -48   -57   -68
___   ___   ___   ___
28    36    44    25  ← Errors

Pattern identified: Student subtracts smaller from larger digit (regardless of position)
45 - 23: Correctly did 5 - 3 = 2, 4 - 2 = 2 → 22 (Error: wrote 28)
72 - 48: Did 8 - 2 = 6 (should regroup), 7 - 4 = 3 → 36 (Error: no regrouping)

Root cause: Doesn't understand regrouping concept
```

**Targeted intervention**:
```
Not needed: More random subtraction practice (wastes time)
Needed: Specific regrouping instruction

Week 1: Base-ten blocks (concrete regrouping)
Week 2: Visual models (pictorial regrouping)
Week 3: Abstract practice (numerical regrouping)

Worksheets: 15 targeted regrouping worksheets (generated in 10.5 minutes)
Result: Directly addresses misconception (efficient intervention)
```

## Data-Driven Decision Making

**Graphs guide next steps**

### Progress Monitoring Graphs

**Visual representation of growth**:
```
Student: Emma (Tier 2 reading intervention)

Graph:
100 WPM |                                        ← Goal line
        |                               x
 80 WPM |                         x
        |                   x
 60 WPM |             x    ← Benchmark
        |       x
 40 WPM | x   x    ← Aimline (expected progress)
        |x
 20 WPM |___________________________________
        Week 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10

Analysis:
Weeks 1-4: Below aimline (not growing fast enough)
Decision: Increase intervention intensity (3× to 5× per week)
Weeks 5-10: Above aimline (strong response to increased support)
Next: Continue current intervention (working well)
```

---

### Decision Rules

**When to change tiers**:
```
Exit Tier 2 → Tier 1:
- Student reaches benchmark (3 consecutive data points at/above)
- Progress maintained for 4 weeks
- Example: Reading fluency reaches 60+ WPM for 4 weeks

Continue Tier 2:
- Student making adequate progress (growing toward benchmark)
- Hasn't reached goal yet, but aimline trend positive

Increase to Tier 3:
- Student not responding (8 weeks, minimal growth)
- Still significantly below benchmark
- Example: Only 3 WPM growth in 8 weeks (inadequate response)

Exit Tier 3 → Tier 2:
- Strong growth, approaching benchmark
- Can benefit from small group instead of individual

Evaluation for special education:
- Tier 3 for extended time (20+ weeks) with inadequate response
- Significant gap persists despite intensive intervention
```

---

## Intervention Scheduling

**Finding time in the school day**

### Master Schedule for Interventions

**30-minute intervention block** (daily 10:00-10:30):
```
Tier 1 students (26): Independent work
- Choice 1: Read independently
- Choice 2: Math games
- Choice 3: Computer practice
- Choice 4: Enrichment worksheets

Tier 2 students (4): Small group with teacher
- Reading group: Phonics worksheets
- Duration: 25 minutes

Tier 3 student (1): Work with interventionist
- Individual phonics lesson
- Duration: 30 minutes (1-on-1)

System: Tier 1 students engaged in meaningful work while teacher provides intensive support to those who need it most
```
