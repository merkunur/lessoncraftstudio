Type keywords like animals, shapes, or colors to filter the image library. Select individual images by clicking them in the preview area. Selected images highlight with a blue border. Click again to deselect unwanted images. Upload your own custom images using the file upload button. Select multiple JPEG, PNG, or GIF files at once from your computer. Uploaded images combine with library images for personalized kindergarten worksheets. Check the custom selection checkbox to use only your manually selected images instead of the entire theme. This option gives you precise control over which images appear on your printable bingo cards. Teachers creating sight words worksheets select specific vocabulary images. Teachers making phonics worksheets choose images for target letter sounds. ESL teachers switch the image library language selector to load culturally appropriate images.
