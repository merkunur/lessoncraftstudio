        question: 'How Does Image-to-Letter Matching Work?',
        answer: 'In image-to-letter mode, each picture appears in the left column and its starting letter appears in the right column in randomized order. Students draw lines connecting each image to the correct initial letter. For example, a picture of a cat connects to the letter C. This mode develops letter-sound correspondence, a fundamental phonics skill for kindergarten literacy instruction.',
