## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Stripe Account** - Active Stripe account with API access
2. **Business Registration** - Your business must be registered
3. **Tax Nexus** - Determine where you have tax obligations
4. **Pricing** - Stripe Tax costs 0.5% of transaction value + standard Stripe fees

## üöÄ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Enable Stripe Tax in Dashboard

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)

3. Click **"Enable Stripe Tax"**
4. Complete the onboarding questionnaire:
   - Business location
   - Business type (SaaS/Digital services)
   - Where you sell to

### Step 2: Configure Tax Settings

#### A. Set Your Product Tax Category

1. Go to **Products** ‚Üí **Tax settings**
2. For digital products/SaaS, select:

   - This ensures correct VAT/GST treatment globally

#### B. Configure Tax Registrations

```

```
