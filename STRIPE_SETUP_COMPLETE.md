# Stripe Payment System - Setup Status

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE - Requires Webhook Configuration

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. **Billing Page Redirect Issue** - FIXED
**Problem:** After payment, users were redirected to `/en/dashboard/billing` regardless of their language preference.

**Solution:** Updated `frontend/app/pricing/page.tsx` to dynamically construct locale-aware redirect URLs based on user's language setting.

**Result:** Users are now redirected to their correct locale's billing page (e.g., `/de/dashboard/billing`, `/fr/dashboard/billing`, etc.)

---

### 2. **Stripe API Authentication Issue** - FIXED
**Problem:** The application was using placeholder Stripe API keys ("placeholder") instead of real test keys.

**Root Cause:** The `.env` file in the standalone directory (`/opt/lessoncraftstudio/frontend/.next/standalone/.env`) had placeholder values that were overriding the correct keys in `.env.production`.

**Solution:**
- Updated the standalone `.env` file with real Stripe test keys
- Restarted PM2 with `--update-env` flag to apply changes

**Files Updated:**
- `/opt/lessoncraftstudio/frontend/.next/standalone/.env`

**Keys Configured:**
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY]
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY]
STRIPE_PRICE_CORE_MONTHLY=price_[REDACTED]
STRIPE_PRICE_CORE_YEARLY=price_[REDACTED]
STRIPE_PRICE_FULL_MONTHLY=price_[REDACTED]
STRIPE_PRICE_FULL_YEARLY=price_[REDACTED]
```

**Note:** Real Stripe keys are configured on the server in `.env` files. Keys are redacted here for security.

**Result:** Stripe API calls now work correctly. Users can create checkout sessions and make payments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING: Webhook Configuration

### Current Status
The webhook endpoint is implemented and ready, but the webhook secret is still a placeholder: `whsec_test1234567890`

### Why This Matters
Without a properly configured webhook:
- ‚ùå Subscriptions won't automatically update in the database after payment
- ‚ùå Users won't see their subscription status change immediately
- ‚ùå Invoice events (paid/failed) won't be recorded
- ‚ùå Subscription renewals and cancellations won't be tracked

### How to Complete Webhook Setup

#### Step 1: Access Stripe Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"

#### Step 2: Configure Webhook
- **Endpoint URL:** `https://www.lessoncraftstudio.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- **Description:** LessonCraftStudio Production Webhook
- **Events to listen for:** Select these events:
  - `checkout.session.completed`
  - `customer.subscription.created`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - `invoice.paid`
  - `invoice.payment_failed`

#### Step 3: Get Webhook Signing Secret
After creating the webhook, Stripe will show you a signing secret that looks like:
```
whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Step 4: Update Environment Files
Update the webhook secret in BOTH files on the server:

```bash
# SSH into server
ssh root@65.108.5.250

# Update .env.production
cd /opt/lessoncraftstudio/frontend
sed -i 's|STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_test1234567890|STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=YOUR_REAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET|' .env.production

# Update standalone .env
sed -i 's|STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_test1234567890|STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=YOUR_REAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET|' .next/standalone/.env

# Restart application
pm2 restart lessoncraftstudio --update-env
```

#### Step 5: Test Webhook
1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to your webhook endpoint
2. Click "Send test webhook"
3. Select `checkout.session.completed` event
4. Check PM2 logs: `pm2 logs lessoncraftstudio --lines 50`
5. Should see "Webhook received" without "Invalid signature" errors

- [ ] Verify subscription appears in `/en/dashboard/billing` after payment
- [ ] Check database: User's `subscriptionTier` should update from 'free' to 'core' or 'full'

**Important:** Before accepting real payments, you MUST:
1. Activate your Stripe account
2. Switch to live keys (sk_live_* and pk_live_*)
3. Update product prices with live price IDs
4. Configure live webhook endpoint

### Subscription Tiers
- **Free:** $0/month (1 worksheet generator)
- **Core:** $15/month or $144/year (10 generators)
- **Full:** $25/month or $240/year (33 generators)

### Webhook Handler Location

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Never commit `.env` files to git
   - Always use test keys for development/testing
   - Rotate keys if accidentally exposed

2. **Webhook Security:**
   - Webhook signature verification is implemented
   - Only Stripe-signed events are processed
   - Idempotency is handled (prevents duplicate processing)

3. **Database:**
   - All payment records are logged
   - Activity logs track subscription changes
   - Payment failures trigger user notifications

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check PM2 logs: `pm2 logs lessoncraftstudio --lines 100`
2. Verify Stripe keys are correct
3. Test webhook in Stripe Dashboard
4. Check database for subscription records: `SELECT * FROM "Subscription" WHERE "userId" = 'YOUR_USER_ID';`
