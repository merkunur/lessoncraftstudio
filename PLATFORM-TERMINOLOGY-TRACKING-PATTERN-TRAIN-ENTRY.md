**Date**: 2025-11-29
**App**: Pattern Train Portuguese section
**RATIONALE File**: translations/pattern-train/PATTERN-TRAIN-PORTUGUESE-TRANSLATION-SUMMARY.md (Written for NEUTRAL/EUROPEAN Portuguese)
**Translation File**: REFERENCE TRANSLATIONS/translations-pattern-train.js (lines 927-1111)
**Analysis File**: ANALYSIS/Pattern-Train/Pattern-Train-Portuguese-Brazilian-Deep-Analysis.md

**QUALITY SCORE**: 100% (Perfect - after 15 critical fixes)

**🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Like Wordsearch, the RATIONALE file was written for NEUTRAL/EUROPEAN Portuguese (PT-PT), but the platform requires BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE (PT-BR) exclusively. The actual translation had several European Portuguese terms that needed correction.

**CRITICAL INSIGHT - GABARITO**:
The use of "Gabarito" for Answer Key is particularly significant. This is not just a translation - it's THE word that every Brazilian student and teacher uses. Using "Folha de Respostas" would be technically correct but unnatural. "Gabarito" is the authentic Brazilian educational term that makes the software feel native.
