## Introduction: Limitations of Traditional Testing

**Traditional assessment**:
```
Format: Multiple choice + fill-in-blank test
What it measures: Recognition and recall
What it misses: Application, creativity, problem-solving, communication

Example:
Question: "What is 8 × 7?"
Student: Writes "56"
Proof: Student knows this fact

BUT: Test doesn't show if student understands WHAT multiplication means or CAN APPLY it to real situations
```

**Research** (Wiggins, 1990): Authentic assessment better predicts **real-world performance** than traditional tests

**Alternative assessment**:
```
Format: Performance task, project, demonstration
What it measures: Application, synthesis, problem-solving
What it reveals: Deep understanding + skills

Example:
Task: "Design a garden that is 8 feet × 7 feet. Calculate area. Draw to scale. Plan what to plant."
Student: Applies multiplication, uses spatial reasoning, makes decisions, communicates visually

Proof: Student UNDERSTANDS multiplication as area calculation AND can apply to authentic context
```

**Key principle**: Assessment should mirror how knowledge is used in real world
