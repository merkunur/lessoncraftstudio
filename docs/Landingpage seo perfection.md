## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Problem (Brutally Honest Assessment)

LessonCraftStudio has ~3,663 landing pages across 11 locales. Current state:

**Content Quality: 4/10 - Template-Heavy, Pedagogically Hollow**

1. **90% identical structure** across all 50 themes - only nouns are swapped
2. **Zero genuine expertise** - claims "research shows" without citations
3. **Keyword stuffing** instead of strategic targeting - generic terms everyone uses
4. **FAQs are product-focused** (50%) rather than pedagogically valuable
5. **Internal linking is random** - no educational or SEO rationale
6. **Non-EN content is literal translation** - not culturally adapted
7. **Schema markup incomplete** - missing FAQ, HowTo, LearningResource on most pages
8. **No AI Overview optimization** - content not structured for featured snippets
9. **Grade-specific content is paint-by-numbers** - identical developmental claims per grade
10. **No competitive differentiation** - nothing a teacher can't find on 100 other sites

### The Vision

Transform every landing page into an **indispensable educational resource** that:
- Ranks for **high-intent, long-tail keywords** with zero cannibalization
- Provides **genuine pedagogical value** that teachers bookmark and share
- Earns **natural backlinks** through unique data, tools, and insights
- Gets **featured in AI Overviews** through structured, definitive answers
- Builds **topical authority clusters** where each page strengthens others
- Achieves **E-E-A-T signals** through expertise, experience, authoritativeness, trust

### Page Inventory

| Page Type | EN Pages | x11 Locales | Total |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Product Pages | 33 | 363 | 363 |
| Theme Hub Pages | 50 | 550 | 550 |
| Theme+Grade Pages | 250 | 2,750 | 2,750 |
| **Landing Page Total** | **333** | **3,663** | **3,663** |

Supporting pages (not "landing pages" but will be optimized):
| Grade Hub Pages | 5 | 55 | 55 |
| Category Pages | 8 | 88 | 88 |
| Static Pages | ~10 | ~110 | ~110 |
| Blog Posts | ~200 | ~2,200 | ~2,200 |

## METHODOLOGY: THE SEO PERFECTION FRAMEWORK

### Three Expert Perspectives

Every part is designed through three lenses:

**1. SEO Expert Lens** (Search Engine Optimization)
- Intent-driven keyword clusters (not just primary keywords)
- Zero cannibalization between pages (strict keyword ownership)
- Schema markup for rich snippets (FAQ, HowTo, LearningResource)
- Internal linking topology (hub-spoke with equity flow)
- AEO (AI Engine Optimization) structuring
- E-E-A-T signal embedding

**2. Web Developer Lens** (Technical Excellence)
- Core Web Vitals compliance (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Semantic HTML5 structure (proper heading hierarchy)
- Structured data validation (schema.org compliance)
- Lazy loading, image optimization, minimal JS
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**3. Content Creator Lens** (Expert Educational Content)
- Research-backed claims with actual citations
- Grade-appropriate developmental psychology
- Culturally adapted localization (not translation)
- Unique voice per theme (not template-swapped nouns)
- Actionable teaching strategies teachers can use Monday morning
- Parent engagement content with real activities

### Keyword Strategy Framework

**Intent Mapping Per Page Type:**

| Page Type | Primary Intent | Keyword Pattern | Length |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Product Page | Transactional | "{app} worksheet generator free" | 4-6 words |
| Theme Hub | Commercial Investigation | "best {theme} worksheets for kids" | 5-7 words |
| Theme+Grade | Informational + Action | "{theme} worksheets {grade} printable free" | 5-8 words |

**Cannibalization Prevention Rules:**
1. Each page owns ONE primary keyword - no other page may target it
2. Product pages own "generator/maker/creator" keywords
3. Theme hubs own "collection/activities/resources" keywords
4. Theme+grade pages own "{grade} + {theme}" long-tail keywords
5. Blog posts own "how to/best/guide/tips" informational keywords
6. Keyword ownership is tracked in `docs/seo-keywords/` per locale

**Keyword Cluster Structure (per page):**
- 1 Primary keyword (H1, URL, meta title, first 100 words)
- 3-5 Secondary keywords (H2s, body paragraphs)
- 5-10 LSI/semantic keywords (naturally throughout content)
- 2-3 Question keywords (FAQ section, for People Also Ask)

### Content Quality Standards

**Minimum Requirements Per Landing Page:**
- 800+ words of unique, value-driven content (not filler)
- At least 1 research citation or data point
- At least 1 unique insight not found on competitor pages
- Hierarchical headers (H1 > H2 > H3) with keyword placement
- Primary keyword in: URL, H1, meta title, meta description, first 100 words
- 3+ internal links to related pages (with anchor text strategy)
- 1+ external authoritative link (research, standards, organizations)
- FAQ section with 5+ genuine questions (not product FAQs)
- Mobile-optimized layout with tap-friendly elements
- Schema markup: minimum WebPage + BreadcrumbList + one rich type

### Content Differentiation Strategy

**What makes each theme page UNIQUE (not template-swapped):**

Instead of: "Animals captivate children..." / "Space captivates imagination..." / "Dinosaurs fascinate kids..."

Each theme must have:
1. **A unique pedagogical angle** - WHY this theme works differently than others
2. **Theme-specific research** - Studies or data about THIS theme's educational impact
3. **Original teaching strategies** - Techniques specific to THIS theme (not generic)
4. **Real classroom examples** - Scenarios teachers actually encounter
5. **Differentiated FAQ** - Questions unique to THIS theme's challenges
6. **Cultural context** - How THIS theme connects to children's real-world experiences
7. **Limitation acknowledgment** - Honest about when this theme is NOT the best choice

### Technical SEO Standards

**Every landing page must have:**
- Canonical URL (self-referencing)
- Hreflang alternates for all 11 locales
- Open Graph tags (title, description, image, type, locale)
- Twitter Card (summary_large_image)
- JSON-LD structured data (validated via Google Rich Results Test)
- Semantic HTML5 (article, section, nav, aside, figure)
- Image optimization (WebP, lazy loading, explicit width/height)
- Breadcrumb navigation (both visual and schema)
- Mobile viewport meta tag
- Robots: index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large

### AI Overview Optimization (AEO)

**Structure content for AI extraction:**
- Lead with a concise definition/answer (2-3 sentences)
- Use tables for comparisons (grade levels, difficulty, features)
- Use numbered lists for processes (how-to, steps)
- Use bullet lists for features/benefits
- Include a "Quick Answer" box at the top of key sections
- Structure FAQs with question as H3, answer as immediate paragraph
- Use "What is...", "How to...", "Best..." heading patterns

### Internal Linking Topology

**Hub-Spoke Model:**
```
Homepage
  |-- /apps/ (Apps Hub)
  |     |-- /apps/[product] (33 Product Spokes)
  |     |-- /apps/category/[cat] (8 Category Spokes)
  |     |-- /apps/grades/[grade] (5 Grade Spokes)
  |
  |-- /worksheets/ (Worksheets Hub)
  |     |-- /worksheets/[theme] (50 Theme Hub Spokes)
  |     |     |-- /worksheets/[theme]/[grade] (5 Grade Sub-Spokes each)
  |
  |-- /blog/ (Blog Hub)
        |-- /blog/[post] (200+ Content Spokes)
```

**Link Equity Flow Rules:**
1. Theme hubs link DOWN to their 5 grade pages
2. Grade pages link UP to their theme hub
3. Grade pages link ACROSS to same-grade different-theme pages
4. Theme hubs link ACROSS to 3 related themes
5. Product pages link to theme pages where app appears
6. Theme pages link to product pages for featured apps
7. Blog posts link to relevant product AND theme pages
8. Every page links back to its parent hub

## APPENDIX F: CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Context Refresh Protocol
When starting a new part:
1. Read this plan file (`docs/Landingpage seo perfection.md`)
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project rules
3. Read `C:\Users\rkgen\.claude\projects\C--Users-rkgen-lessoncraftstudio\memory\MEMORY.md`
4. Check the progress tracking table above
5. Ask: "Do you want me to start Part X?"
6. Wait for explicit YES before starting

### File Encoding Warning
- Many .tsx/.ts files use Unicode escapes
- Use Node.js scripts for file manipulation when dealing with special characters
- Use `scripts/fix-unicode.js` after Write tool if needed
- Never use PowerShell for file operations

### Golden Rules
1. NEVER start a part without permission
2. ONE PART AT A TIME - full capacity on each
3. Validate EVERYTHING before moving on
4. No template language ("captivates children", "research shows")
5. Every page must be genuinely unique
6. Every keyword must be owned by exactly one page per locale
7. Every claim must be backed by evidence
8. Every page must pass the "would a teacher bookmark this?" test
9. Deploy and verify after each locale phase
10. Document everything for context continuity
