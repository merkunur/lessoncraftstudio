This flexibility lets you create kindergarten worksheets that match your lesson plans exactly. Next, choose your exercise mode. Fill-in-the-blank format works well for first grade students who can write independently. Multiple choice format suits younger kindergarten students or ESL learners. Both formats teach spatial concepts effectively. The exercise mode determines your worksheet layout just like choosing formats for math worksheets or sight words worksheets. Select how many exercises appear on each worksheet. Choose from one to eight exercises per page. More exercises create comprehensive practice sheets. Fewer exercises work better for struggling students or assessment situations. Adjust the count based on student needs just as you would for phonics worksheets or alphabet worksheets. Decide whether to include name and date fields. Check this option to add student information areas at the top of worksheets. Leave unchecked for generic worksheets you can photocopy multiple times.
