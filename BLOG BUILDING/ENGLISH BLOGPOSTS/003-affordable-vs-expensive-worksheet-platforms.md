## Introduction: The $200 Question

You're comparing checkout pages. Three browser tabs open:

- **Tab 1**: Teachers Pay Teachers Unlimited - $89.95/year
- **Tab 2**: Education.com Premium - $109.99/year
- **Tab 3**: LessonCraftStudio.com Core Bundle - $144/year

**Your brain calculates**: "The first two total $200. The third is $144. But TPT is only $90..."

**Before you click "Subscribe" on the cheapest option**, ask yourself:

**Question 1**: Can I *edit* TPT worksheets after downloading?
**Answer**: No. Static PDFs only.

**Question 2**: Can Education.com create worksheets in 3 minutes with complete customization?
**Answer**: No. Pre-made content or limited generators.

**Question 3**: Does LessonCraftStudio.com auto-generate + let me edit everything?
**Answer**: Yes. Only platform combining both.

**ROI Formula**: (Time Value Saved − Annual Cost) ÷ Annual Cost

#### **LessonCraftStudio.com Core Bundle** ($144/year)

**Time saved** (vs manual creation, 3 worksheets/week):
- 108 worksheets × 42 min saved = 75.6 hours

**ROI**: ($2,268 − $144) ÷ $144 = **14.75× return**

**Plus commercial license**: Sell 10 packs on TPT, 50 copies at $4 = $200 additional income
→ Subscription pays for itself + $56 profit

---

#### **TPT Unlimited** ($89.95/year)

**Time saved**: Minimal (search time vs manual creation ≈ similar)
- Static PDFs mean recreating in Word for customization
- No time savings for differentiation

**ROI**: 0-2× (depends on usage frequency)

---

#### **Canva Pro** ($119.99/year)

**Time cost**: 45 min per worksheet (manual design)

**ROI**: 3-5× (depends on usage)

## The Hidden Costs

### TPT Unlimited's Hidden Limitation

**Advertised**: "Unlimited downloads for $89.95/year!"

**Reality**:
- Download worksheet for Johnny (on-grade level)
- Need large-print version for Emma (IEP accommodation)
- Must buy DIFFERENT resource (another $4-8)
- Or spend 30 minutes recreating in Word

**Annual hidden cost**: 10 IEP modifications × 30 min × $30/hour = $150 time cost
**Total effective cost**: $89.95 + $150 = **$239.95/year**

---

### Canva Pro's Time Tax

**Advertised**: "Design anything for $119.99/year!"

**Reality**:
- Create word search from scratch: 45 minutes
- 3 worksheets/week × 36 weeks = 108 worksheets
- 108 × 45 min = 81 hours/year

**Time cost**: 81 hrs × $30/hour = **$2,430 annually**
**Total effective cost**: $119.99 + $2,430 = **$2,550/year**

---

### LessonCraftStudio.com's True Cost

**Advertised**: Core Bundle $144/year

**Reality**:
- Time saved: 75.6 hours × $30 = $2,268 value
- Commercial license: Can generate $200+ income
- 10 generators cover 80% of needs

**Net cost**: $144 − $200 (TPT income) = **−$56 (makes money)**
