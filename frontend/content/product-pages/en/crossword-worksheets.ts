        question: 'How Many Images Do I Need to Create a Picture Crossword Worksheet?',
        answer: 'The crossword generator requires exactly 8 images to create a complete puzzle. This consistent count ensures crosswords remain appropriately challenging for kindergarten worksheets and first grade worksheets without overwhelming young learners. Select 8 images from our library, upload 8 custom pictures, or combine library and uploaded images totaling 8. The 8-image requirement creates an optimal puzzle size fitting standard letter or A4 paper while providing sufficient vocabulary practice. Fewer images result in too-simple puzzles lacking educational value. More images create overly complex crosswords frustrating for early readers working on phonics worksheets or sight words worksheets. Our algorithm automatically places these 8 words in a 15×15 grid maximizing word intersections for engaging alphabet worksheets. Use the manual edit mode if you want to specify which 8 images from a larger collection appear in your crossword. Browse our 3000+ image library and click exactly 8 pictures for your kindergarten worksheets. The generator builds the crossword using only your selected vocabulary.',
