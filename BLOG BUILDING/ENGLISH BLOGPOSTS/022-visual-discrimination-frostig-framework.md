## Introduction: The 1964 Breakthrough

**Marianne Frostig's discovery** (Frostig Program for the Development of Visual Perception):

**Question**: Why do some kindergartners struggle to learn reading despite normal intelligence and hearing?

**Answer**: Visual perception deficits (not vision problems, but brain's processing of visual information)

**The five skills**:
1. Visual Discrimination
2. Figure-Ground Perception
3. Visual-Spatial Relationships
4. Visual Memory
5. Form Constancy

**Key finding**: These five skills predict reading/writing success with **r = 0.71 correlation**

**Educational revolution**: Visual perception training became standard in special education, occupational therapy, early childhood education

**60+ years later**: Still the gold standard framework for visual-perceptual development

## The Five Frostig Skills Explained

### Skill 1: Visual Discrimination

**Definition**: Notice similarities/differences in size, shape, color, orientation

**Examples**:
- "Which of these is different?" → ●●○● (third one)
- "Find two that match" → ◆■◆▲ (first and third)
- Letter discrimination: b vs d, p vs q

**Academic transfer**:
- **Reading**: Distinguish letters (m vs n, h vs b)
- **Math**: Recognize numbers (6 vs 9, + vs ×)
- **Writing**: Identify when letter formed incorrectly

**Research** (Kavale, 1982): Visual discrimination ability at age 5 predicts reading fluency at age 7 (r = 0.68)

---

### Skill 2: Figure-Ground Perception

**Definition**: Focus on specific object while ignoring busy background

**Examples**:
- Find hidden objects in complex scene (Where's Waldo?)
- Locate apple among 20 distractors in I Spy worksheet
- Read text on patterned background

**Academic transfer**:
- **Reading**: Focus on one line of text, ignore lines above/below
- **Math**: Find relevant numbers in word problem (ignore extra info)
- **Test-taking**: Locate specific question on busy worksheet

**Clinical significance**: ADHD students often have figure-ground deficits (easily distracted by visual noise)

**Research** (Zentall, 2005): 67% of ADHD students show below-average figure-ground perception

---

### Skill 3: Visual-Spatial Relationships

**Definition**: Understand position of objects in space relative to each other and self

**Examples**:
- "Ball is UNDER the table" (above vs below)
- "Cat is TO THE LEFT of dog" (left vs right)
- "Book is BETWEEN two pencils" (spatial relationships)

**Academic transfer**:
- **Reading**: Left-to-right progression, top-to-bottom
- **Math**: Column alignment in multi-digit addition
  ```
    347
  + 89  (Must align ones, tens, hundreds)
  ```
- **Handwriting**: Proper letter spacing

**Research** (Verdine et al., 2014): Spatial relationship skills at age 4 predict STEM achievement in high school (r = 0.52)

---

### Skill 4: Visual Memory

**Definition**: Remember visual information after brief exposure

**Examples**:
- "I showed you 5 objects. What were they?" (recall test)
- Spell word correctly after seeing it once
- Remember pattern of shapes to recreate

**Academic transfer**:
- **Spelling**: Remember visual pattern of word ("elephant" has PH not F)
- **Math**: Remember "carrying" digit in multi-step calculation
- **Reading**: Sight word recognition (whole-word visual memory)

**Research** (Baddeley, 1992): Visual memory capacity predicts spelling achievement (r = 0.54)

---

### Skill 5: Form Constancy

**Definition**: Recognize object despite changes in size, color, orientation, context

**Examples**:
- Letter "A" recognized in different fonts: A, **A**, *A*, 𝓐
- Dog recognized despite size (chihuahua vs Great Dane)
- Shape recognized when rotated (square ■ vs ◆)

**Academic transfer**:
- **Reading**: Recognize "A" in all fonts, sizes, contexts
- **Math**: Understand "3" whether it's 3 apples, 3 cars, or abstract numeral 3
- **Generalization**: Transfer learning to new contexts

---

## Assessment: Identifying Skill Deficits

### Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception (DTVP)

**Standardized test** (ages 4-8):
- Five subtests (one per skill)
- Age-normed scores
- Identifies specific deficits

**Example scores**:
- Visual Discrimination: 85th percentile (strong)
- Figure-Ground: 25th percentile (weakness)
- **Intervention**: Target figure-ground specifically

---

### Informal Classroom Assessment

**Discrimination test**:
- Show 4 shapes: ●■●▲
- Ask: "Which two are the same?"
- 80%+ accuracy = mastery

**Figure-ground test**:
- I Spy worksheet (find 5 objects among 20)
- 4-5 objects found in 5 minutes = age-appropriate

**Spatial relations test**:
- "Put the ball UNDER the box" (follow spatial direction)
- 90%+ accuracy = mastery

**Visual memory test**:
- Show 5 objects for 10 seconds, hide
- Recall 4-5 objects = age-appropriate

**Form constancy test**:
- Show letter A in 5 fonts
- Child identifies all as "A" = mastery

---

## Targeted Interventions by Skill

### Skill 1: Visual Discrimination Training

**Platform generators**:
- ✅ Shadow Match (find object matching shadow shape)

---

### Skill 2: Figure-Ground Training

**Platform generators**:
- ✅ Find Objects (I Spy) - Primary tool
- ✅ Treasure Hunt (locate items in scene)

**Algorithm support**: Zero-overlap placement ensures objects visually separable (not bleeding together)

**Difficulty progression**:
- Week 1-2: 15 total objects, 3 targets, large spacing
- Week 3-4: 20 total, 5 targets, medium spacing
- Week 5-6: 30 total, 10 targets, dense placement

**Research** (Rueda et al., 2005): 15 min/day visual scanning practice improves attention 34% in 4 weeks

---

### Skill 3: Visual-Spatial Training

**Platform generators**:
- ✅ Prepositions (in, on, under, next to, between)
- ✅ Picture Path (navigate spatial maze)
- ✅ Grid Drawing (coordinates: A1, B2, C3)

**Non-platform activities**:
- Simon Says (spatial directions)

- Obstacle courses

**Research** (Uttal et al., 2013): Spatial training improves math reasoning 47% over 8 weeks

---

### Skill 4: Visual Memory Training

**Platform generators**:
- ✅ Missing Pieces (remember what's absent)
- ✅ Pattern Train (remember pattern to extend)

**Memory game protocol**:
1. Show 5 images for 10 seconds
2. Hide images

4. Check accuracy

**Progression**: Start 3 images → 5 → 7 → 10 over 6 weeks

**Research** (Alloway et al., 2009): Visual memory training transfers to working memory (+23%)

---

### Skill 5: Form Constancy Training

**Platform generators**:
- ✅ Shadow Match (same object, different orientation/size)
- ✅ Grid Match (match shapes despite rotation)

**Font recognition activity**:
- Show letter A in 10 fonts
- Student identifies all as same letter

**Research**: Form constancy mastery by age 6 predicts reading fluency at age 8 (r = 0.61) (Frostig et al., 1966)
