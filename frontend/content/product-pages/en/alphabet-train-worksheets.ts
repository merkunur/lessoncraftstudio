Click any letter to select it for your worksheet. You must choose exactly 11 letters to fill all train wagons. The counter shows how many letters you have selected.

Next, browse the image library to find pictures for each letter. Select a theme from the dropdown menu to narrow your choices. Animals, food, and everyday objects are popular options. Click the search box and type specific words to find exact images. When you click an image, it automatically assigns to the matching letter.

Watch the assigned images panel to track your progress. Each letter shows its paired image as a small preview. All 11 letters need images before you can generate. The auto-create mode skips this step entirely. Just enable it and pick a theme for instant random selection.`,
