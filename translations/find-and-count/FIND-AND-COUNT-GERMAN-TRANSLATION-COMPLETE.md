## üéØ GERMAN-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS

### 1. **Compound Words**
German naturally forms compound words, used where appropriate:
- "Hintergrund-Transparenz" (Background Opacity)
- "Rahmen-Transparenz" (Border Opacity)
- "Spracheinstellungen" (Language Settings)
- "Seiteneinrichtung" (Page Setup)

### 2. **Technical Terms**
Choosing intuitive over literal translations:
- "Transparenz" instead of "Deckkraft" for opacity
- "Kontur" instead of "Umriss" for outline
- "Raster" for grid (standard German)
- "Ebenen" for layers (standard in German graphics software)

### 3. **Educational Terminology**
Aligned with German school system:
- "Bildsammlung" instead of "Bildbibliothek" (more natural)
- "Eigene Bilder" for custom images (personal, clear)
- "Suchaufgaben" for hidden object questions (activity-focused)
- "Textwerkzeuge" for text tools (standard terminology)

### 4. **Measurement Notation**
Following German conventions:
- Decimal comma: "8,5√ó11\"" instead of "8.5√ó11\""
- Metric preference: "210√ó297mm" prominently displayed
