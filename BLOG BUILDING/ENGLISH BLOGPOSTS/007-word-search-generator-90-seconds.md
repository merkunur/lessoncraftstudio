## Why Word Searches Improve Spelling

### Orthographic Learning Theory (Ehri, 1995)

**Traditional practice**: Write "rainbow" 10 times
- Focus: Motor memory
- Visual encoding: Minimal

**Word search practice**: Visually scan for "r-a-i-n-b-o-w"
- Focus: Visual analysis
- Encoding: Deep processing (comparing sequences)

**Result**: Word searches produce **3.2× better retention** vs passive copying (Share, 1995)

---

### Self-Teaching Hypothesis (Share, 1995)

**Each successful word identification teaches spelling patterns**

**Example**: Searching for "thunder"
- Brain encounters: "th...un...der"
- Learns: "th" digraph, "un" vowel pattern, "er" ending
- Transfers to: "under," "blunder" (same patterns)

---

## Configuration Options

### Grid Size Strategy

**Small (12×12)**: PreK-1st
- 4-8 short words (3-5 letters)
- Large letters, easy scanning
- Completion: 5-8 minutes

**Medium (16×16)**: 2nd-4th
- 8-12 words (4-8 letters)
- Moderate challenge
- Completion: 10-15 minutes

**Large (20×20)**: 5th+
- 12-15 words (6-12 letters)
- Dense grid, requires patience
- Completion: 15-20 minutes

---

### Direction Options (Difficulty Scaling)

**Horizontal only** (→): Very Easy
- Best for: Struggling readers, ESL beginners, ages 5-6

**Horizontal + Vertical** (→↓): Easy-Medium
- Best for: Grades 1-2

**Horizontal + Vertical + Diagonal** (→↓↘↙): Medium-Hard
- Best for: Grades 2-5

**All directions + Backwards** (→←↓↑↘↙↖↗): Very Hard
- Best for: Gifted students, upper elementary
- Cognitive demand: 4× higher (check 8 directions per letter)

---

### Image Options

**Enable images when**:
- Teaching ESL/ELL (visual context)
- Working with visual learners (dual coding)
- Introducing new vocabulary
- Students ages 4-8 (concrete operational stage)

**Disable images when**:
- Advanced spellers (remove scaffolding)
- Abstract vocabulary (democracy, justice)
- Maximizing challenge
- Saving ink

## Post-Generation Editing (The Advantage)

### What Static Generators Can't Do

**Typical generator**:
1. Enter words
2. Click "Generate"
3. Download PDF
4. If imperfect → Regenerate and pray

---

### What Editable Platform Does

**All tiers** (Free, Core, Full):
1. Enter words
2. Generate
3. **EDIT everything**: move, resize, swap, delete
4. Download when perfect

---

### Real-World Editing

**Scenario 1**: IEP Large Print
- Generate → Select all → Increase 18px to 27px (10 seconds)
- vs recreating in Word (30 minutes)

**Scenario 2**: Custom Image
- Generate → Click image → Upload field trip photo (15 seconds)
- Student engagement: 3× higher

**Scenario 3**: Layout Fix
- Title overlaps grid → Drag title upward (5 seconds)
- vs regenerating 10 times (10 minutes)

---

---

### Are word searches effective learning, or just busywork?

**Effective when**:
- Vocabulary reinforcement (after direct instruction)
- Spelling practice (focus on letter sequences)
- Review (spiraling content)

**Ineffective when**:
- Teaching new content (doesn't explain meanings)
