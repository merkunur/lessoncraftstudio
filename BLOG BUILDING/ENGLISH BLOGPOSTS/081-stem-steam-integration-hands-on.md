## Introduction: STEM vs STEAM

**STEM**: Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics
**STEAM**: Science, Technology, Engineering, **Art**, Mathematics

**Why add Art** (Maeda, 2013): Art develops creativity, design thinking, innovation (critical for 21st-century careers)

**Research** (Becker & Park, 2011): Integrated STEM instruction improves problem-solving **25-35%** compared to siloed subject teaching

**Traditional science**: Read about concept, answer questions
```
Lesson: Learn about bridges
Activity: Read textbook, define suspension bridge
Assessment: Define terms on worksheet
Problem: No hands-on application (abstract knowledge only)
```

**STEM integration**: Read, design, build, test, iterate
```
Lesson: Learn about bridges
Activity: Read about bridge types (worksheet), design own bridge (drawing), build with materials (hands-on), test weight capacity (experiment), redesign to improve (engineering iteration)
Assessment: Explain design choices (written reflection)
Result: Deep understanding through DO-ing
```

**Key principle**: Worksheets SUPPORT hands-on (not replace it)

1. Ask (identify problem)
2. Imagine (brainstorm solutions)
3. Plan (choose best idea, design)
4. Create (build prototype)
