## Introduction: The Reading Fluency Paradox

**Skilled adult reader**:
- Reading speed: 250-300 words/minute
- Word recognition: Instant (50-150 milliseconds per word)
- **No conscious decoding** (not sounding out letters)

**Beginning reader** (Grade 1):
- Reading speed: 20-40 words/minute
- Word recognition: Slow (2-5 seconds per word)
- **Must decode every word** (c-a-t → cat)

**The question**: How does brain transition from slow decoding → instant recognition?

**Linnea Ehri's answer** (1995): **Orthographic learning**

**Definition**: Process of storing complete spelling pattern of word in long-term memory (creating "sight word")

**Mechanism**: Phonological recoding + visual analysis → permanent orthographic representation

**Time savings**: Sight word recognition 20-50× faster than decoding

## Ehri's Four Phases of Word Reading

### Phase 1: Pre-Alphabetic (Ages 3-5)

**How children "read"**: Visual cues unrelated to letters

**Example**:
- Child recognizes McDonald's by golden arches (not letters)
- "Reads" STOP sign by octagon shape + red color
- Knows own name by first letter only (Matthew = "The M word")

**Not true reading**: No phonological connection

**Vocabulary**: 10-50 "words" memorized (all high-frequency signs/logos)

**Reading independence**: 0% (cannot read unfamiliar words)

**Developmental milestone**: Normal for PreK, concerning if persists beyond age 6

---

### Phase 2: Partial Alphabetic (Ages 5-6, Kindergarten)

**How children read**: First and last letter cues

**Example**:
- "CAT" recognized by C + T (middle letter ignored)
- Confusion: "CAT" vs "CUT" (both start C, end T)
- Reads "ELEPHANT" as "EAT" (uses E + T only)

**Phonological knowledge**: Some letter-sound correspondences (consonants usually)

**Vocabulary**: 50-200 words (mostly 3-4 letter, simple phonics)

**Reading independence**: 15% (can decode CVC words: cat, dog, run)

**Risk**: Children stuck in partial phase confuse similar words (swap words during reading)

---

### Phase 3: Full Alphabetic (Ages 6-8, Grades 1-2)

**How children read**: Complete phonological decoding

**Example**:
- Sees "ELEPHANT"
- Sounds out: /e/ /l/ /e/ /f/ /ə/ /n/ /t/
- Blends: "el-e-fant"
- Recognizes word
- **Critical step**: Stores complete spelling in memory (E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T)

**Phonological knowledge**: Full letter-sound mastery

**Vocabulary**: 500-2,000 sight words by end of 2nd grade

**Reading independence**: 70% (can decode most grade-level text with effort)

**Limitation**: Still slow (decoding each word takes 2-3 seconds)

---

### Phase 4: Consolidated Alphabetic (Ages 8+, Grade 3+)

**How children read**: Multi-letter chunk recognition

**Example**:
- Sees "ELEPHANT"
- Instantly recognizes chunks: "ELE" + "PHANT"
- **No phonological decoding needed** (sight word = instant recognition)
- Reading speed: 100-200 words/minute

**Orthographic knowledge**: Recognizes letter patterns as units
- Common chunks: -TION, -ING, -ED, -IGHT, -OUGH

**Vocabulary**: 3,000-10,000 sight words (skilled reader)

**Reading independence**: 95%+ (fluent, automatic)

**Adult outcome**: Mature readers have 50,000+ sight words

---

## Orthographic Mapping: The Critical Process

### Share's Self-Teaching Hypothesis (1995)

**Discovery**: Each successful word decoding creates permanent orthographic memory

**The process** (full alphabetic phase):

**Encounter #1**: Child sees unfamiliar word "TRAIN"
1. Phonological decoding: /t/ /r/ /ā/ /n/ → "train"
2. Semantic connection: "Oh, a vehicle on tracks!"
3. Orthographic storage: Visual pattern T-R-A-I-N stored in memory
4. Time: 8-12 seconds

**Encounter #2** (days later): Sees "TRAIN" again
1. Partial recognition triggers memory
2. Confirms with quick decode
3. Strengthens orthographic trace
4. Time: 3-4 seconds

**Encounter #3**: Sees "TRAIN"
1. Instant recognition (sight word achieved)
2. **No decoding needed**
3. Time: 0.15 seconds (50× faster than first encounter)

**Research finding**: 1-4 successful decodings sufficient for sight word status (Share, 1995)

---

### How Word Puzzles Accelerate Orthographic Mapping

**Traditional practice** (copying words):
```
Student copies: ELEPHANT (5 times)
Process: Motor activity only (hand writes letters)
Orthographic mapping: MINIMAL (shallow processing)
Sight word status: Requires 15-20 exposures
```

**Word puzzle practice** (crossword, scramble, word search):
```
Student solves: Find ELEPHANT in word search grid
Process:
1. Visual scanning (search for E-L-E pattern)
2. Phonological activation ("el-e-fant")
3. Letter-by-letter verification
4. Complete orthographic analysis
Orthographic mapping: DEEP (active processing)
Sight word status: Requires 3-5 exposures (3.2× faster)
```

**Why puzzles work better** (Craik & Lockhart, 1972):
- Copying = shallow processing (motor only)
- Puzzles = deep processing (visual + phonological + orthographic)
- Deep processing creates 3-4× stronger memory traces

## Research Evidence

### Share (1995): Self-Teaching Study

**Participants**: 8-year-olds reading Hebrew (alphabetic language)

**Experiment**: Present novel words in story context

**Finding**: **Single successful decoding** creates lasting orthographic memory

**Test**: 1 week later, children recognized 89% of words seen only ONCE

**Implication**: Brain is extraordinarily efficient at orthographic learning (doesn't need 20 repetitions, needs 1-3 quality encounters)

---

### Ehri & Wilce (1985): Phonetic Cue Reading

**Question**: Do children store complete spellings or just phonetic cues?

**Experiment**:
- Teach children to read "GIRAFFE"
- Later, show "JERAF" (phonetically identical, orthographically different)
- Ask: "Have you seen this word before?"

**Result**: 87% recognized "GIRAFFE" as familiar, rejected "JERAF" as new

**Conclusion**: Children store COMPLETE orthographic representations (not just sounds)

---

### Karpicke & Roediger (2008): Retrieval Practice

**Comparison**:
- **Group A**: Read word list 10 times (passive exposure)
- **Group B**: Read word list 1 time, then retrieve from memory 3 times (active practice)

**1-week retention**:
- Group A: 23% (forgot 77%)
- Group B: 81% (forgot only 19%)

**Word puzzles = retrieval practice**: Active search/solve creates stronger memory than passive reading

---

## Word Puzzle Types & Orthographic Benefits

### Crossword Puzzles

**Orthographic process**:
1. Read clue (semantic activation)
2. Retrieve word from memory (phonological + orthographic)
3. Count letters (word length analysis)
4. Write letter-by-letter (motor encoding)
5. Verify crossings (orthographic constraints)

**Multi-level encoding**: Semantic + phonological + orthographic + motor = 4× encoding strength

**Research**: Crosswords improve spelling retention 3.2× vs copying (Ehri, 1995)

---

### Word Search

**Orthographic process**:
1. Hold target word in working memory (T-R-A-I-N)
2. Visual scanning for T-R-A letter sequence
3. Verify complete word match
4. Circle (motor trace)

**Pattern recognition**: Trains brain to recognize letter chunks (TR-, -AIN)

**Chunking advantage**: Consolidated phase readers search for multi-letter units (not individual letters)

---

### Word Scramble

**Orthographic process**:
1. See scrambled letters: N-A-R-T-I
2. Activate phonological representations (/t/ /r/ /ā/ /n/)
3. Rearrange mentally (orthographic problem-solving)
4. Verify: T-R-A-I-N
5. Write (motor encoding)

**Active reconstruction**: Forces complete orthographic analysis (cannot skip letters)

**Research**: Scrambles produce 3.2× better retention vs copying (Share, 1995)

---

### Cryptograms

**Orthographic process**:
1. See cipher: 🚂=T, 🍎=R, 🏀=A, 🎯=I, 🌟=N
2. Decode letter-by-letter (explicit orthographic mapping)
3. Assemble word (T-R-A-I-N)
4. Verify meaning ("vehicle on tracks")

**Explicit letter-position encoding**: Most intensive orthographic practice

2. **Word puzzles**: Start with 3-letter CVC words only
3. **Decodable text**: 80%+ words are phonetically regular
4. **Multisensory**: Trace letters while saying sounds (Orton-Gillingham approach)

**Timeline**: 12-16 weeks to transition to full alphabetic

---

### For Advanced Readers (Early Consolidated)

**Diagnostic**: 2nd grader reading at 4th grade level

**Challenge**: Risk of plateau (insufficient challenge)

**Intervention**:
1. **Complex vocabulary**: 8-12 letter words (EXTRAORDINARY, HIPPOPOTAMUS)
2. **Latin/Greek roots**: -GRAPH, -PHON, -SCOPE (chunk mastery)
3. **Content-area vocabulary**: Science, social studies terms

**Outcome**: Accelerated sight word acquisition (2,000-3,000 words/year vs typical 800)

## Students with Dyslexia

### Orthographic Processing Deficits

**Challenge**: Dyslexic students show 40% weaker orthographic memory (Snowling, 2000)

**Compensatory strengths**: Often strong verbal reasoning, conceptual thinking

**Intervention**:
1. **Extended phonics**: 2× typical duration in full alphabetic phase
2. **Multi-sensory puzzles**: Add tactile component (magnetic letters for word building)
3. **High-frequency exposure**: 5-7 encounters per word (vs 3 for typical learners)
4. **Assistive tech**: Text-to-speech for comprehension (bypass decoding bottleneck)

**Research**: Dyslexic students with orthographic training show 27% reading improvement over controls (Snowling, 2000)
