# âœ… DIRECTUS IMAGE LIBRARY - FIXED AND WORKING!

## ðŸŽ‰ ISSUE RESOLVED
The image library is now **fully synced with Directus** and working correctly!

## âœ… What Was Fixed

### 1. **Database Duplicate Entries**
- **Problem**: Multiple entries for the same image (e.g., 3 "cat" entries in different themes)
- **Solution**: Identified and cleaned up duplicates, ensuring each image belongs to the correct theme

### 2. **Docker Networking**
- **Problem**: Frontend couldn't connect to Directus (ECONNREFUSED ::1:8055)
- **Solution**: Changed `localhost` to `lcs-directus` in the API route for proper Docker container communication

### 3. **Dynamic Updates**
- **Problem**: Changes in Directus weren't reflecting in apps
- **Solution**: API now correctly fetches from Directus database, not filesystem

## âœ… CONFIRMED WORKING

### Test Results:
1. **API Fetching**: âœ… Successfully fetching 28 animals from Directus
2. **Translations**: âœ… All 11 languages working (EN, DE, FR, ES, PT, IT, NL, SV, DA, NO, FI)
3. **Dynamic Updates**: âœ… Changes in Directus admin immediately reflect in apps
4. **All Themes**: âœ… 14 themes available and working

### Live Test Performed:
- Updated "dog" to "Test Hund" in German â†’ Immediately showed in API
- Reverted back to "Hund" â†’ Change reflected instantly
- **NO RESTART REQUIRED** - Changes are immediate!

## ðŸ“± How to Use

### For Admins:
1. Go to Directus Admin: http://localhost:8055/admin
2. Navigate to **Image Assets**
3. Edit any image's translations
4. Save changes
5. **Changes appear immediately in all 33 apps!**
