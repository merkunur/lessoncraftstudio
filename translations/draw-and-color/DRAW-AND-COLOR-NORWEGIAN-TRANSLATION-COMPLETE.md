### Language Style Notes
- Uses natural Norwegian verb forms
- Maintains professional tone for interface elements
- Natural, flowing Norwegian that doesn't feel translated
- Appropriate register for grunnskole context
- Clear use of Norwegian letters (√¶, √∏, √•)

### Unique Norwegian Features
- **"Rutenettegning"** - Clear compound word for grid drawing
- **"Hjelpeceller"** - Natural compound for helper/clue cells
- **"Ingen (Tilfeldig)"** - Clear indication of random placement
- **"Ramme"** - Natural choice for decorative borders
- **"f.eks."** - Standard abbreviation for examples

### Norwegian Educational Terminology
- Grid method widely used in Norwegian art education
- "Arbeidsark" is the standard term for worksheets
- "Lag" (Make/Create) preferred for the generate button
- "Bildebibliotek" follows Norwegian compound word structure
- Aligns with Kunnskapsl√∏ftet curriculum

### Special Considerations
- Norwegian uses compound words (rutenettegning, hjelpeceller)
- Uses "vannrett" (horizontal) and "loddrett" (vertical) consistently
- "Synlighet" used for opacity (more natural than "gjennomsiktighet")
- Norwegian educational software typically uses informal address
- "Last opp" (upload) and "last ned" (download) are standard terms

### Direction Terminology
- **"Vannrett"** - Horizontal (water-right)
- **"Loddrett"** - Vertical (plumb-right)
- These are standard Norwegian directional terms used in educational contexts

### Linguistic Note on Bokm√•l vs Nynorsk
This translation uses bokm√•l, which is:
- Used by 85-90% of Norwegian municipalities
- The standard in Oslo and eastern Norway
- More similar to Danish in written form
- The most common choice for software interfaces
