        description: 'Open the Page Setup accordion section for printing options. Select your paper size from six choices. Letter Portrait fits standard US printers. A4 Portrait works for international schools. Choose the size matching your printer and location. Letter Landscape orientation provides wider worksheets. Some teachers prefer this layout for math puzzles. A4 Landscape works similarly for European printers. Square format creates unique-looking printable worksheets. Default worksheet size works well for most situations. Test different sizes to find your preference. Click the page color picker to change background color. White background saves the most printer ink. Light colors like pale yellow or blue add visual interest. Avoid dark colors that waste ink and make addition worksheets hard to read. Most kindergarten worksheets use white or very light backgrounds. Select a background theme if desired. Click the Background Theme dropdown menu. Browse available background patterns. Adjust opacity if the background looks too dark. Lower opacity makes backgrounds lighter and more subtle. This keeps math problems clearly visible on free printable worksheets. Choose a border theme to frame your worksheet. Browse border options in the Border Theme dropdown. Holiday borders add seasonal flair to kindergarten worksheets. Simple borders look professional for first grade math. Adjust border opacity just like backgrounds. Click Apply Size and Color to activate your choices.',
