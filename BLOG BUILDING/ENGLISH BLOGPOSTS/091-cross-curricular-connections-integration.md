## Introduction: Breaking Down Subject Silos

**Traditional approach**: Separate subjects taught in isolation
```
8:00-9:00: Math (no connection to other subjects)
9:00-10:00: Reading (no connection to math)
10:00-11:00: Science (no connection to reading or math)
Result: Fragmented learning (students don't see connections)
```

**Research** (Vars, 2001): Integrated curriculum improves **retention 30-40%** (connections strengthen memory)

**Cross-curricular approach**: One theme across multiple subjects
```
Weekly theme: "Weather"
Math: Graph temperature data (computation + data analysis)
Reading: Weather-themed passages (comprehension + vocabulary)
Science: Weather patterns (meteorology concepts)
Writing: Weather journal (observation + description)
Social Studies: Climate zones (geography connection)

Result: Deep understanding (students see how subjects connect)
```

**Key principle**: Real world doesn't separate subjects - neither should learning

---

## Math + Reading Integration

**Natural connections**: Word problems, data interpretation, measurement

### Story Problem Creation

**Activity**: Students write math story problems based on reading passages
```
Reading passage: "Charlotte's Web" (E.B. White)
Connection: Farm mathematics

Student-created problems:
1. "Wilbur weighs 50 pounds in September and 125 pounds in December. How much weight did he gain?"
2. "Charlotte spun 3 webs per week for 8 weeks. How many webs total?"
3. "If Fern visits Wilbur 5 days per week, how many visits in 4 weeks?"

Benefits:
- Reading comprehension (understand story to create problems)
- Math application (real-world context)
- Creative thinking (connect literature to numbers)
```

---

### Data from Texts

**Activity**: Extract data from nonfiction, create math worksheets
```
Science article: "Animal Speeds"
Data extracted:
- Cheetah: 70 mph
- Lion: 50 mph
- Elephant: 25 mph
- Human: 28 mph (Usain Bolt)

Generated worksheets:
1. Bar graph: Plot animal speeds
2. Word problems: "How much faster is a cheetah than an elephant?"
3. Multiplication: "If a cheetah runs for 3 hours at 70 mph, how far?"

Time: 42 seconds to generate math worksheet from science data
Academic value: Students practice math AND learn science facts
```
