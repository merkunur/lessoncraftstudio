## CRITICAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

**TIER 2 keywords only appear 1 time each instead of required 10+ times.**

The current Section 7 approach of using each keyword once in separate H3 titles is insufficient. We need 9 MORE occurrences for each TIER 2 keyword.

### Why This Happened
- Section 7 has only 5 H3 subsections
- Each H3 can only reasonably contain 2-4 keywords
- 8 TIER 2 keywords × 10 required = 80 keyword instances needed
- Current structure can only accommodate ~20 keyword instances

### Solution Required
**Need to add 30-40 MORE H3 subsections** across Sections 2-7 that incorporate TIER 2 keywords multiple times.

Example additional H3s needed:
- "Sudoku with Addition Worksheets for Kindergarten Math Practice"
- "Phonics Worksheets and Sudoku - Complete Reading Foundation"
- "Alphabet Worksheets Combined with Logic Puzzles for First Grade"
- "Tracing Worksheets and Sudoku for Fine Motor Development"
- etc.

**Current total H3s:** ~38
**Required total H3s:** 70-80 to hit all keywords 10+ times

---

## RECOMMENDATION

The sudoku app page needs significant expansion to meet SEO requirements. Should we:

1. **Add more H3 subsections to existing sections** (20-30 more H3s)
2. **Expand Section 7** from 5 to 15-20 H3 subsections focusing on TIER 2 keywords
3. **Revise H2/H3 titles** to include multiple keywords per title where natural

This is a structural issue requiring substantial additional content.
