    differentiationNotes: `Struggling learners benefit from naming the four main parts of a flower and describing the function of each \u2014 such as sepals protecting the bud before it opens, petals attracting pollinators through color and scent, stamens producing pollen that contains male reproductive cells, and the pistil containing the ovary where seeds develop after pollination \u2014 and describing how one type of pollinator like a bee helps flowers reproduce by carrying pollen from the stamens of one flower to the stigma of another as it feeds on nectar. Advanced learners benefit from analyzing the co-evolutionary relationships between flowers and specific pollinators, explaining how flower color, scent, shape, and nectar reward have evolved to match their pollinators\u2019 sensory abilities and feeding behaviors \u2014 for example how bee-pollinated flowers are blue or yellow because bees see those colors well but cannot see red, while hummingbird-pollinated flowers are red because birds see red well \u2014 and writing a multi-paragraph report comparing pollination strategies of bee-pollinated, bird-pollinated, and wind-pollinated flowers, explaining how each flower type has evolved specific traits to match its pollination method.`,
