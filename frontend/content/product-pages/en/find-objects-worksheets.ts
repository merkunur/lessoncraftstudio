        title: 'Select I Spy Worksheets or Odd One Out Worksheets - Free Worksheet for Kids',
        description: 'Open the find objects generator and choose your activity mode first. Select I Spy mode for traditional hidden objects worksheets. Choose Odd One Out mode for matching and visual discrimination practice. Your selection determines how students interact with your kindergarten worksheets and first grade worksheets. The mode you choose affects the entire worksheet structure and learning objectives. For I Spy mode, select 8-12 distractor images from the library first. Browse by theme to see related images grouped together. Search for specific objects using keywords like "animals" or "vehicles." Then choose 1-5 hidden objects students will search for among the distractors. Start with 1-2 hidden objects for beginning kindergarten students. Use 3-5 objects for advanced first graders ready for challenges. Click theme dropdowns to auto-populate images or manually click individual images. Manual selection gives precise control over worksheet content. For Odd One Out mode, select 8-12 pairs of matching images carefully. Each pair should look identical or very similar. Students find images without matching partners among the pairs. Choose 1-3 odd images that appear unpaired in the layout. Start with 1 odd image for younger students. Use 2-3 odd images for students comfortable with visual discrimination. The mode creates free printable worksheets testing visual matching skills and attention to detail. Both modes access the full 3000+ image library in all 11 languages. Change the image library language to match your curriculum needs. Switch between modes instantly to create varied addition worksheets, tracing worksheets, and sight words worksheets for complete lesson plans. Many teachers create one worksheet in each mode weekly for comprehensive visual skills practice.',

        title: 'Customize Visual Discrimination Worksheets - Free Printable Worksheet for Kindergarten',
        description: 'Select your page size from Letter or A4 formats first. Choose portrait orientation for standard worksheets that fit school folders. Select landscape for wider visual layouts when you need more horizontal space. Custom size option lets you specify exact dimensions in pixels for special projects. Page setup affects all worksheet types including math worksheets, phonics worksheets, and alphabet worksheets equally. Most teachers use Letter Portrait for consistency across all classroom materials. Add a background theme from the themed background library next. Background images add visual interest to kindergarten worksheets without distracting from learning objectives. Choose seasonal backgrounds for holiday units. Select educational backgrounds for curriculum alignment. Adjust background opacity if needed using the slider. Lower opacity creates subtle backgrounds that don\'t compete with main content. Full opacity makes backgrounds prominent for themed worksheet packs. Select fallback color for areas without background images using the color picker. Choose border themes for framing your free printable worksheets professionally. Themed borders match seasonal units and curriculum topics perfectly. Border themes include holidays, seasons, and educational motifs. Adjust border opacity for subtle or bold frames depending on your preference. Lower opacity creates delicate frames while full opacity makes bold statement borders. Add custom text instructions like "Find the hidden animals!" in the text tools section. Type your instruction text and click Add Text to place it on the canvas. Use seven font options with color and outline controls for readable text. Choose child-friendly fonts like Baloo 2 or Quicksand for kindergarten worksheets. Select professional fonts like Lexend Deca for first grade worksheets. Include name and date fields for student accountability and record keeping. These customization options work across all worksheet types for consistent classroom materials and professional presentation.',
