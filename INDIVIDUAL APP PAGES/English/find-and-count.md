First grade worksheets can handle 3-4 objects for more challenge.

### Step 2: Customize Grid Settings for Phonics Worksheets - Adjust Rows for First Grade Worksheets, Sight Words Worksheets

Set your grid dimensions using the row and column controls. Drag the sliders or type numbers directly into the boxes. Rows range from 5 to 10 for varying difficulty. Columns range from 5 to 10 as well. A 6×6 grid creates 36 total cells to fill. Larger grids make worksheets more challenging for students.

Choose your page size from the dropdown menu. Letter portrait (8.5×11 inches) works for most classroom printers. A4 portrait fits European standard paper sizes. Landscape orientations provide wider worksheet layouts. Square formats create unique visual designs. Custom dimensions let you specify exact pixel measurements. The page size affects how large grid images appear. Math worksheets typically use letter portrait for consistent formatting.

Select background colors or decorative themes if desired. Click the page color picker to choose a solid background. Browse background themes for patterned or illustrated backgrounds. Adjust background opacity using the slider control. Border themes add decorative frames around worksheet edges. Border opacity controls how prominent the frame appears.

Select which action students should perform when finding that object. Circle tasks involve drawing circles around objects. Square tasks require drawing rectangular boxes. Cross out tasks mean drawing X marks. Count tasks ask students to write the total number found.

Click any element on the canvas to select it. Selected objects display corner handles and a rotation control. Drag objects to new positions anywhere on the page. Images can overlap or spread out as needed. The drag function works smoothly for quick repositioning. Move text, borders, backgrounds, and grid images freely. Everything stays editable even after worksheet generation completes.

Resize objects using the corner handles. Drag corners outward to make images larger. Pull corners inward to shrink images smaller. Hold Shift while dragging to maintain proportions. Release Shift to stretch width or height independently. Resize individual grid images for emphasis. Make hidden objects slightly larger as hints. Adjust text size for better readability on kindergarten worksheets.

Rotate any object using the rotation handle. Click the circular arrow icon above selected objects. Drag the handle clockwise or counterclockwise. Images rotate smoothly to any angle. Tilted images add visual interest to free printable worksheets. Rotate text for creative header designs. Grid images can tilt for a playful appearance. Reset rotation by typing 0 in the angle field.

Delete unwanted elements with the delete button or keyboard key. Select objects you want to remove. Press Delete or click the trash icon. Deleted items disappear immediately from the canvas. The undo button reverses accidental deletions. Redo restores deleted items if you change your mind. Remove grid images to create easier worksheets. Delete backgrounds or borders for simpler designs.

Layer controls adjust which objects appear in front. Select an object and click Bring to Front. That object moves above all others on the canvas. Send to Back pushes objects behind everything else. Bring Forward and Send Backward move objects one layer at a time. Proper layering makes text readable over images. Math worksheets benefit from clear text hierarchy.

Lock objects to prevent accidental changes. Click the lock icon after positioning elements perfectly. Locked objects cannot move, resize, or rotate. They remain selectable but not editable.
