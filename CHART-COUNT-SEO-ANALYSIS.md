## Content Writing Guidelines for Chart Count

### Terminology to Use Consistently

- **"Picture graph"** or **"picture graph worksheet"** (not just "graph" or "chart")
- **"Count and color"** (describes the activity)
- **"Data visualization"** (educational benefit)
- **"Graphing skills"** (math skill area)
- **"Coloring boxes"** (what students do)
- **"Answer key"** (always mention - it's a major value prop)

### Unique Selling Points to Emphasize

1. **Math + Art Integration** - Coloring is part of the learning process
2. **Data Visualization for Young Learners** - Foundation for later statistics
3. **Automatic Answer Key** - Huge time-saver for teachers
4. **Visual Learning** - Perfect for ESL, visual learners, special needs
5. **Counting Practice** - Core kindergarten skill (1-5 range)
6. **Two-Part Worksheet** - Image grid + graph work together

### What Makes Chart Count DIFFERENT from Other Apps

- **Not a puzzle** - It's a data activity
- **Math focus** - Counting + graphing (not literacy)
- **Coloring as learning** - Color boxes to show data (not just decoration)
- **Answer key essential** - Shows correct data representation
- **Educational scaffolding** - Instructions guide graph creation process

### Avoid These Mistakes

❌ Calling it a "chart" (use "picture graph")
❌ Ignoring the coloring aspect (it's a MAJOR keyword!)
❌ Forgetting the answer key (mention in every section)
❌ Focusing only on counting (also emphasize data/graphing skills)
❌ Missing the math connection (this is fundamentally a MATH worksheet)
