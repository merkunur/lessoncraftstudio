## ✅ CONSISTENCY ACHIEVEMENTS

### 1. Naming Convention - FIXED
All files now use the **EXACT SAME PATTERN**:
- Pattern: `GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_[CODE]`
- Examples:
  - `GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_DA` (Danish)
  - `GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_NO` (Norwegian)
  - `GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_FI` (Finnish)

### 2. Danish Conflict - RESOLVED
- ✅ Kept better translation: "Gitterspil" (game-like, natural)
- ❌ Removed old translation: "Gitter-parring" (technical, literal)
- ✅ Updated language names to simple format (no parentheses)

### 3. File Organization - COMPLETE
- ✅ All files in `/translations/grid-match/`
- ✅ Consistent naming: `grid-match-professional-[language]-translation.js`
- ✅ No duplicate files
- ✅ No scattered files in root

### 4. Structure Consistency - PERFECT
All files have:
- ✅ Same key structure (189 keys each)
- ✅ Same comment organization
- ✅ Same export pattern
- ✅ Same constant naming convention

## 🎯 READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### To Use in Application:

1. **Import all translations:**
```javascript
// In your main app file
import { GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_EN } from './translations/grid-match/grid-match-professional-english-translation.js';
import { GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_DA } from './translations/grid-match/grid-match-professional-danish-translation.js';
import { GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_NO } from './translations/grid-match/grid-match-professional-norwegian-translation.js';
import { GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_FI } from './translations/grid-match/grid-match-professional-finnish-translation.js';
// ... import all other languages

const GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS = {
  ...GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_EN,
  ...GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_DA,
  ...GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_NO,
  ...GRID_MATCH_TRANSLATIONS_FI,
  // ... spread all other languages
};
```

2. **Or create a master file** (like wordsearch might have):
```javascript
// translations/grid-match/index.js
export * from './grid-match-professional-danish-translation.js';
export * from './grid-match-professional-norwegian-translation.js';
// ... etc
```
