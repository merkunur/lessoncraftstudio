## Introduction: Copyright Basics for Educators

**Important disclaimer**: This is educational information, not legal advice. Consult an attorney for specific legal questions.

**Why copyright matters for teachers**:
```
Common scenarios:
- Photocopying worksheets from books
- Downloading images from Google
- Sharing purchased materials with colleagues
- Creating materials for side tutoring business

Risk: Copyright infringement (civil penalties, job consequences)
Reality: Many teachers unknowingly violate copyright daily
```

**Key principle**: Just because something is online doesn't mean it's free to use

---

## Understanding Copyright Law

**Basics every educator should know**

### What is Copyrighted?

**Automatically protected**:
```
As soon as created, these are copyrighted:
- Books and textbooks
- Worksheets and workbooks
- Images and illustrations
- Videos and films
- Music and songs
- Software and apps

No registration required: Copyright exists from moment of creation

Symbol: © indicates copyright (but absence doesn't mean unprotected)
```

---

### Public Domain vs Copyrighted

**Public domain** (free to use):
```
Materials in public domain:
- Very old works: Published before 1928 (generally)
- Government works: Created by US federal government
- Explicitly released: Creator waived rights

Examples:
- Shakespeare's plays (old)
- NASA photos (government)
- Some Creative Commons content (released)

Safe to use: No permission needed
```

**Still copyrighted**:
```
- Modern books and textbooks (within last 95 years)
- Most commercial worksheets
- Contemporary images and photos
- Licensed characters (Disney, etc.)

Requires: Permission or license to use
```

---

## Fair Use in Education

**Limited exception to copyright**

### Four-Factor Test

**Courts evaluate fair use using 4 factors**:

**Factor 1: Purpose**
```
Favors fair use:
- Educational, non-profit use
- Classroom instruction
- Teaching and learning

Against fair use:
- Commercial purpose
- For-profit tutoring
- Selling materials
```

---

**Factor 2: Nature of Work**
```
More likely fair use:
- Factual works (textbooks, encyclopedias)
- Published works

Less likely fair use:
- Creative works (novels, poems, artwork)
- Unpublished works
```

---

**Factor 3: Amount Used**
```
More likely fair use:
- Small portion (one chapter, not whole book)
- Only what's necessary for lesson

Less likely fair use:
- Entire work used
- "Heart" of the work
```

---

**Factor 4: Market Effect**
```
Favors fair use:
- Does NOT harm sales of original
- Not replacing purchase

Against fair use:
- Replaces need to buy original
- Causes financial harm to creator
```

**All 4 factors considered**: Not a simple checklist, nuanced analysis

---

## Common Teacher Scenarios

**Is it legal?**

### Scenario 1: Photocopying Workbook Pages

**Question**: "Can I photocopy pages from a consumable workbook for my class?"

**Analysis**:
```
Situation: Teacher bought one workbook ($15), photocopies for 30 students

Copyright holder's view:
- Intended sale: 30 workbooks × $15 = $450
- Actual sale: 1 workbook = $15
- Lost revenue: $435

Fair use analysis:
❌ Purpose: Educational (favors fair use)
❌ Amount: Substantial portion (against fair use)
❌ Market effect: Clearly harms sales (strongly against fair use)

Verdict: Generally NOT fair use (publisher's copyright protection has been upheld in court)
```

**Legal alternative**:
```
- Purchase class set (expensive but legal)
- Use subscription service (like worksheet generators)
- Request school/district to purchase
```

---

### Scenario 2: Google Image Search

**Question**: "Can I use images from Google in my worksheets?"

**Analysis**:
```
Common misconception: "It's on Google, so it's free"
Reality: Google search finds copyrighted images

Most images: Protected by copyright (photographer/artist owns)

Safe options:
✓ Public domain: Openclipart.org, Pixabay.com (verify license)
✓ Creative Commons: Some allow educational use (read specific license)
✓ Your own photos: You own copyright
✓ Generator's images: Included in subscription (licensed for use)

Risky:
✗ Random Google images: Unknown ownership, likely copyrighted
✗ Disney characters: Heavily protected (enforce aggressively)
✗ Celebrity photos: Owned by photographer, not free to use
```

---

### Scenario 3: Teachers Pay Teachers

**Question**: "Can I share purchased TPT resources with my teaching team?"

**Analysis**:
```
TPT licenses: Usually "single classroom use"

What you CAN do:
✓ Use in your own classroom
✓ Modify for your students
✓ Project for your class

What you CANNOT do:
✗ Share with colleague (even same school)
✗ Post to school shared drive
✗ Email to another teacher

Why: Seller loses potential sale (market harm)

To share: Purchase additional licenses (TPT offers multi-teacher pricing)
```

---

### Scenario 4: YouTube Videos in Class

**Question**: "Can I show YouTube videos to my class?"

**Analysis**:
```
Generally allowed:
✓ Show video to class (educational purpose)
✓ Use for teaching (face-to-face instruction)

Conditions:
- Lawfully obtained video (not pirated)
- Shown in class (not performed publicly outside educational setting)
- Entire class can watch (not public screening)

Not allowed:
✗ Downloading and keeping copy (violates YouTube Terms of Service)
✗ Removing ads (required by copyright holder)
✗ Public screening (parent night ≠ classroom instruction)
```

---

## Creating Your Own Materials

**Ownership and rights**

### Teacher-Created Worksheets

**If you create original content**:
```
You own copyright:
- Original worksheets you designed
- Your own photos
- Your own lesson plans

Rights you have:
✓ Use in your classroom
✓ Share with colleagues (if you choose)
✓ Sell on TPT (if you wish)

Exceptions - you DON'T own if:
- Created as "work for hire" (some districts claim ownership)
- Used copyrighted elements (Disney characters in your worksheet)
- Adapted from copyrighted source
```

---

### Commercial Use Rights

**Side businesses and tutoring**:
```
Classroom materials: Often OK for your classroom
Commercial use: Requires different permission

Example:
- School worksheet: Can use in your class
- Tutoring business: Need commercial license

Why: Different purpose (non-profit vs for-profit)

Worksheet generators:
- Free/Core: Classroom use only
- Full plan: Commercial license included ($240/year)
```

---

## Attribution Requirements

**Giving credit where due**

### When Attribution Needed

**Scenarios**:
```
Using others' work:
- Must credit: Creative Commons content (if license requires)
- Should credit: Public domain (not required but ethical)
- Cannot use without permission: Fully copyrighted

Your own work:
- Optional: "Created by [Your Name]"
- If selling: Watermark or footer recommended
```

---

### Proper Attribution Format

**Example**:
```
Image: "Sunset over mountains" by John Doe
License: Creative Commons BY 2.0
Source: flickr.com/photos/johndoe/12345

Or:

Photo by John Doe (CC BY 2.0)
```

---

## District Policies

**Know your employer's rules**

### Work-for-Hire Doctrines

**Some districts claim ownership**:
```
Policy: "Materials created on school time/using school resources belong to district"

Implications:
- Worksheets created during prep period: District may claim ownership
- Lesson plans written at home: Possibly yours (but check policy)
- Materials made with school copier: District may own

Reality: Varies by district (read your contract)

Safe approach: Assume materials created for school belong to school
```

---

### Acceptable Use Policies

**Technology use guidelines**:
```
Typically prohibit:
- Copyright infringement
- Illegal downloading
- Sharing copyrighted materials
- Using unlicensed software

Violation consequences:
- Disciplinary action
- Loss of tech privileges
- Job termination (severe cases)
```

---

## Protecting Your Own Work

**If you create and sell materials**

### Copyright Your Work

**Protection steps**:
```
1. Copyright exists automatically (no registration needed)
2. Add copyright notice: "© 2025 [Your Name]. All rights reserved."
3. Consider registration: $65 with US Copyright Office (for enforcement)
4. Watermark: Visual indication it's yours
```

---

### Terms of Use

**When selling on TPT or your website**:
```
Clear license terms:
- "Single classroom use" OR "Multi-teacher license"
- "For personal use only" OR "Commercial use allowed"
- "Do not share, resell, or redistribute"

Enforcement: DMCA takedown notices if pirated
```

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

**High-risk activities**

### Don't Do This:

```
❌ Photocopy entire workbooks
❌ Download worksheet PDFs from "free" sites (often pirated)
❌ Use Disney/Pixar characters without license
❌ Share single TPT purchase with entire school
❌ Sell materials with copyrighted images
❌ Screen record and distribute copyrighted videos
❌ Copy textbook chapters for class sets
```

---

## Safe Alternatives

**Legal options**

### Recommended Practices:

```
✓ Use worksheet generators (licensed for classroom use)
✓ Public domain images (verified sources)
✓ Create original content
✓ Purchase appropriate licenses
✓ Respect TPT single-user licenses
✓ Follow district policies
✓ Seek permission when unsure
```

## Conclusion

Copyright protects creators' rights - educators must respect intellectual property while accessing quality materials.

**Automatic protection**: Books, worksheets, images, videos copyrighted from creation (no registration needed)

**Fair use**: Four-factor test (purpose, nature, amount, market effect), not automatic pass for education

**Common scenarios**: Photocopying workbooks generally not fair use ($435 lost revenue), Google images mostly copyrighted (use Openclipart/Pixabay instead), TPT single-classroom licenses (can't share with colleagues)

**YouTube in class**: Generally allowed (face-to-face instruction), don't download or remove ads

**Teacher-created**: You own original content (unless work-for-hire policy applies), need commercial license for tutoring business

**Generator licenses**: Free (classroom with watermark), Core $144 (classroom, no watermark), Full $240 (commercial use allowed)

**Attribution**: Credit Creative Commons content (if required), ethical to credit public domain

**District policies**: Check work-for-hire doctrines (some districts claim ownership of materials created on school time)

**Red flags**: Don't photocopy workbooks, use pirated sites, share single TPT licenses, use Disney characters without permission

**Safe alternatives**: Generators (licensed), public domain images, original content, appropriate licenses

**When in doubt, seek permission - respect creators' rights while accessing quality educational materials.**
