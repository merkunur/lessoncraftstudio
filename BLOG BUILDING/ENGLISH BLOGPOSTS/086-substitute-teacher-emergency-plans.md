## Introduction: The Sub Plan Crisis

**Teacher reality**: Need substitute on short notice (illness, emergency, professional development)

**Problem**: Creating sub plans at 5:30 AM while sick
```
6:00 AM: Wake up with flu
6:15 AM: Call for sub
6:30 AM: Try to write lesson plans (feeling terrible)
7:00 AM: Give up, leave generic "have them read" note
Result: Wasted school day (sub doesn't know what to teach)
```

**Solution**: Pre-made emergency plans (created when healthy)

**Research** (Weems & Rogers, 2007): Quality substitute plans maintain **90% of regular learning** vs **40%** with poor/no plans

**Best practice**: Have 3-5 days of complete sub plans ready at all times

## Self-Explanatory Worksheets

**Key principle**: Sub doesn't need to teach new content

**Worksheet features for sub plans**:

### Clear Instructions on Worksheet

**Example math worksheet header**:
```
Name: _________________ Date: _______

DIRECTIONS:
1. Solve each addition problem
2. Show your work
3. Check your answers with the answer key (on teacher's desk)
4. If you get 8 or more wrong, ask the substitute for help
5. When finished, place in the turn-in basket

Expected time: 30 minutes
```

**Sub-friendly**: Instructions ON worksheet (sub doesn't need to explain)

---

### Familiar Activity Types

**Use worksheets students already know**:
```
✓ Math computation (practiced weekly - students know format)
✓ Word searches (done regularly - self-explanatory)
✓ Crosswords (familiar puzzle type)
✓ Coloring (everyone knows how to color)

✗ New game rules (sub can't teach unfamiliar activity)
✗ Complex projects (require teacher scaffolding)
✗ Group work (behavior management challenge for sub)
```

---

## Behavior Management for Subs

**Challenge**: Students test boundaries with substitute

**Solution**: Clear expectations + engaging work

### Pre-Written Note to Students

**Include in sub plan**:
```
Dear Class,

I'm out today, but I expect you to show our substitute teacher the same respect you show me. Here's what I expect:

✓ Follow all class rules
✓ Complete all assigned work
✓ Help the substitute if they have questions
✓ Be kind and respectful

I will ask the substitute for a report when I return. Students who meet expectations will earn [reward]. Students who don't will [consequence].

Have a great day!
[Teacher name]
```

**Accountability**: Students know teacher will follow up

---

### Engaging Work (Prevents Boredom)

**Boredom = behavior problems**

**Strategy**: Mix easy + challenging + fun
```
Morning: Standard math (familiar, builds confidence)
Mid-morning: Word search (game-like, engaging)
Before lunch: Coloring (calming, low-stress)
After lunch: Crossword (moderate challenge)
End of day: Math puzzle OR free choice (motivating finish)

Result: Students engaged (less time for misbehavior)
```

---

## Content-Aligned Sub Plans

**Ideal**: Sub plans review current content (not busywork)

### Creating Aligned Plans Monthly

**September (beginning of year)**:
```
Generate sub plans based on September content:
- Math: Addition/subtraction review (skills taught in Sept)
- Vocabulary: September spelling words (in word search/crossword)
- Science: September science terms (in word search)

Result: Even with sub, students practice relevant content
```

**October**:
```
Update sub plans:
- Math: Multiplication (October focus)
- Vocabulary: October words
- Science: October unit terms

Replace September sub plan worksheets with October versions
Time: 10 minutes to generate 5 new worksheets
```

**Ongoing**: Update sub plans monthly (always current content)

---

## Generator Time-Saving for Sub Plans

**Creating 3 days of complete sub plans**:

### Generation Time Breakdown

**Day 1 materials**:
```
Math worksheet: 42 seconds
Word search (vocabulary): 42 seconds
Reading comprehension: 42 seconds
Coloring page: 42 seconds
Science word search: 42 seconds
Crossword: 42 seconds
Math puzzle: 42 seconds

Total: 294 seconds (4 minutes 54 seconds)
```

**Days 2-3**: ~5 minutes each

**Total generation time**: 15 minutes for 3 complete days
**Print time**: 30 minutes (90 worksheets for 30 students)

**Compare to manual**:
- Creating custom worksheets: 21 worksheets × 40 min = 840 min (14 hours)
- With generators: 45 minutes total (15 gen + 30 print)
- **Time saved**: 13.25 hours (can create sub plans in one prep period)

## Last-Minute Emergency Plan (Digital)

**Scenario**: Teacher sick at 5 AM, can't come in, no time to prep

**Digital emergency backup**:

### Google Classroom Emergency Folder

**Pre-created folder** (set up in August):
```
Folder: "Emergency Sub Plans"
Contents:
- Sub Plan Day 1.pdf
- Sub Plan Day 2.pdf
- Sub Plan Day 3.pdf
- Answer Keys.pdf
- Instructions for Sub.pdf

Sub: Gets login from office, accesses folder, follows plans
Students: Already trained to check Google Classroom for assignments

Result: Even with zero-notice absence, learning continues
```

---

## Differentiation in Sub Plans

**Challenge**: Sub can't differentiate like regular teacher

**Solution**: Pre-differentiated materials

### Tiered Worksheet Bins

**Set up in advance**:
```
Bin 1 (Blue): Modified worksheets
- 10 problems instead of 20
- Picture support
- For: Struggling students

Bin 2 (Green): Standard worksheets
- 20 problems
- Grade-level
- For: On-level students

Bin 3 (Red): Challenge worksheets
- 30 problems
- Complex applications
- For: Advanced students

Note to sub: "Students know which color bin to take from. They will self-select appropriate level."

Result: Differentiation happens automatically (no sub decision-making needed)
```

---

## Long-Term Absence Planning

**Scenario**: Teacher out 2+ weeks (surgery, maternity leave, family emergency)

### Extended Sub Plan System

**Week 1-2 materials**:
```
Generate 10 full days of lessons (50+ worksheets)
Organization:
- Monday Week 1 folder (all materials)
- Tuesday Week 1 folder
- ...
- Friday Week 2 folder

Long-term sub: Opens Monday folder, finds everything needed
Time to create: 2-3 hours (one weekend to prepare 2 weeks)

Benefit: Teacher can focus on recovery (not worrying about classroom)
```

---

## Sub Feedback Form

### Form for Sub to Complete

```

## Train Students for Sub Days

**Preparation**: Teach students how to behave with subs

**September training**:
```
Teacher: "Sometimes I'll be out and we'll have a substitute. Here's what I expect:"

Role-play:
- Student volunteers as "sub"
- Class practices:
  * Following instructions from sub
  * Getting worksheets from correct bin
  * Asking sub for help appropriately
  * Cleaning up at end of day

Practice run: "Today we'll pretend it's a sub day"
Students: Follow the emergency sub plan as practice
Result: When real sub comes, students know routine
```
