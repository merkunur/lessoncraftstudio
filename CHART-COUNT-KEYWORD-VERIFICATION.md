## SOLUTION: Add More H3s to Section 7

Need to add 8-10 additional H3 subsections to Section 7 to boost the failing keywords.

### Proposed Additional H3s:

1. **Addition Worksheets and Picture Graph Worksheets** - Kindergarten Math Skills Together
2. **Picture Graph Worksheets with Addition Worksheets** - Complete First Grade Math Packet
3. **Addition Worksheets Combined with Picture Graph Activities** - Data and Computation Integration
4. **Phonics Worksheets Plus Picture Graph Math Worksheets** - Literacy and Math Combined
5. **Picture Graph Worksheets and Phonics Worksheets** - Cross-Curricular Kindergarten Learning
6. **Sight Words Worksheets and Picture Graph Worksheets** - Reading and Math Integration
7. **Picture Graph Math with Sight Words Worksheets** - Vocabulary and Data Skills
8. **Alphabet Worksheets Combined with Picture Graph Worksheets** - Letter and Number Recognition
9. **Picture Graph Worksheets with Alphabet Worksheets** - Early Literacy and Math
10. **Tracing Worksheets Combined with Picture Graph Math Worksheets** - Fine Motor Development
11. **Picture Graph Worksheets and Tracing Worksheets** - Handwriting and Counting Practice

This would bring all failing keywords up to 10+ mentions.

## Current Status

**INCOMPLETE - Section 7 needs expansion with 8-10 more H3 subsections.**
