## Introduction: Professional vs DIY I Spy Worksheets

**Professional I Spy** (OT offices, special ed classrooms):
- Objects perfectly spaced
- Zero overlapping images
- Clean visual layout
- Created with expensive software OR 45+ minutes manual positioning

**DIY I Spy** (homemade versions):
- Clipart crammed together
- Objects bleeding into each other
- Visual clutter defeats therapeutic purpose

**The zero-overlap algorithm** creates professional layouts in 3 seconds.

**Available in**: Core Bundle, Full Access ($144-240/year)

## How the Zero-Overlap Algorithm Works

### The 300-Attempt Process (Happens in 3 Seconds)

**Step 1**: Generate random X,Y coordinates for image

**Step 2**: Collision detection
- Check: Overlaps with previous images?
- Check: At least 25 pixels clear space around image?

**Step 3**: Accept or reject
- No collision → Accept, move to next image
- Collision → Reject, try new coordinates

**Step 4**: Repeat up to 300 times per image
- Statistically guarantees non-overlapping position in 95% of cases

**Step 5**: Fallback (rare)
- If 300 attempts fail, reduce total item count
- Example: Requested 30, only 25 fit → Generate with 25

**Result**: Professional zero-overlap layout in 3 seconds (vs 45+ minutes manual)

---

### Why 25 Pixels Matters

**Visual crowding effect** (Levi, 2008):
- Objects too close → Brain struggles to identify individually
- Critical spacing: ~20-30% of image size

**25-pixel buffer** = 25% of typical 100×100px image
- Exceeds research-recommended 20% threshold
- Each object clearly distinguishable

**Impact on attention**:
- Proper spacing: Student scans systematically, finds objects
- Crowded spacing: Student frustrated, gives up after 2 minutes

## The Science: Frostig & Horne's 5 Visual Perception Skills

**Foundational research** (1964): 5 categories essential for learning

### 1. Visual Discrimination

**Definition**: Notice similarities/differences in size, shape, color

**I Spy practice**: Distinguish target dog from similar cat/fox

**Academic transfer**:
- Reading: Distinguish b from d, p from q
- Math: Recognize 6 vs 9, + vs ×

---

### 2. Figure-Ground Perception

**Definition**: Focus on specific object while ignoring busy background

**I Spy practice**: Find apple among 20 distractors

**Academic transfer**:
- Reading: Focus on one line, ignore lines above/below
- Math: Find relevant numbers in word problem

---

### 3. Visual Spatial Relationships

**I Spy practice**: Scan spatial zones (top-left, middle-right)

**Academic transfer**:
- Reading: Left-to-right progression
- Math: Column alignment in multi-digit addition

---

### 4. Visual Memory

**I Spy practice**: Remember target list while searching

**Academic transfer**:
- Spelling: Remember visual pattern of word
- Math: Remember "carrying" digit

---

### 5. Visual Constancy

**I Spy practice**: Recognize car despite different size/color/orientation

**Academic transfer**: Recognize letter "A" in different fonts

---

## ADHD Attention Training

**Research** (Rueda et al., 2005):
- 15 min/day visual scanning practice
- **34% improvement in sustained attention** after 4 weeks
- Effects transfer to non-visual tasks

**Why I Spy works for ADHD**:
1. Game-like format (intrinsically motivating)
2. Immediate feedback (find object → success)
3. Incremental challenge (3-10 targets)
4. Visual focus (reduces mind-wandering)

---

## Dual Modes

### Mode 1: I Spy (Find Hidden Objects)

**How it works**:
- 15-30 total objects displayed
- Target list: Find 3-10 specific objects
- Student scans, locates, circles each

**Difficulty scaling**:
- Easy: 3 targets, 15 total, large spacing
- Medium: 5 targets, 20 total
- Hard: 10 targets, 30 total, dense placement

---

### Mode 2: Odd One Out (Find Unpaired Items)

**How it works**:
- 10-20 objects displayed
- Most appear in pairs (two identical images)
- 3-6 objects appear solo (unpaired)
- Student finds unpaired "odd ones out"

**Cognitive challenge**:
- Requires matching memory
- Spatial separation of pairs (minimum 100px apart)
- Must scan entire field to confirm "odd"

**Skills practiced**:
- Visual matching (same/different)
- Working memory (track which paired)
- Persistence

## Creating Custom I Spy: 3-Minute Workflow

**Requires**: Core Bundle or Full Access

### Step 1: Configure (60 seconds)

1. Select mode (I Spy or Odd One Out)
2. Number of target objects (3-10)
3. Total objects (15-30)
4. Theme (47 categories or custom upload)

---

### Step 2: Generate (3 seconds)

**Algorithm runs**:
1. Selects target + distractor images
2. Zero-overlap placement (300 attempts per image)
3. Layer-based rendering (creates visual depth)
4. Answer key auto-generated

---

### Step 3: Edit & Export (90 seconds)

**Post-generation editing**:
- Move images (if too close to edge)
- Resize (make elephant larger for emphasis)
- Delete (too many monkeys)
- Add custom images (field trip photos)
- Swap images (replace zebra with giraffe)

**Export**: JPEG or PDF, answer key included

---

## ADHD Classroom Strategies

### Strategy 1: Progressive Disclosure

**Problem**: 30 objects overwhelms, student shuts down

**Solution**: Cover worksheet, reveal gradually
1. Reveal top 1/3
2. Student finds targets in visible area
3. Reveal next 1/3

---

### Strategy 2: Timed Bursts

**Protocol**:
- "Find as many as you can in 3 minutes"
- After 3 min: "Great! 3 more minutes."
- Repeat until complete

**Why**: Short intervals match ADHD attention capacity

---

### Strategy 3: Grayscale Mode

**Problem**: Colorful images overstimulate

**Solution**: Toggle "Grayscale Mode" before export
- Converts to black/white
- Reduces visual noise

**Research**: ADHD students show 19% longer attention on grayscale (Zentall, 2005)

---

## Custom Image Integration

### Example: Zoo Field Trip

**Before trip**: "Take photos of 10 different animals"

**After trip**:
1. Upload 20 student photos
2. Generate I Spy: "Find animals YOU saw!"
3. Student engagement: 95% (their photos!)

---

### Example: Alphabet Letter Hunt

**Setup**:
- Walk around school with camera
- Photo objects starting with each letter (A=Apple poster, B=Basketball)
- Collect 26 photos (A-Z)

**Generate**: I Spy "Find objects for vowels (A, E, I, O, U)"

**Literacy connection**: Phonics, letter-sound correspondence

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What age range is I Spy appropriate for?

**Ages 3-8** (PreK through 3rd grade) for most students

**Adaptations**:
- Age 3-4: 3 targets, 10 total, very distinct shapes
- Ages 5-6: 5 targets, 15-20 total
- Ages 7-8: 8-10 targets, 25-30 total

---

### Can I use I Spy for academic content review?

**Yes!** Creative applications:
- **Sight word review**: Images with words on them, find specific words
- **Math fact practice**: Cards showing equations, find all that equal 5
- **Vocabulary review**: Images representing vocabulary words

---

### How do I make I Spy harder without adding more objects?

**Strategies**:
1. Smaller images (reduce size 50%)
2. Grayscale mode (removes color cues)
3. Similar distractors (find red apple among red balls, red flowers)
4. Rotated objects (same dog rotated 90°, 180°, 270°)
5. Odd One Out mode (requires memory)
