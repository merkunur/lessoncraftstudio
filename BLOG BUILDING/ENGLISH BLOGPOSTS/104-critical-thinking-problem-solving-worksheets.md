## Introduction: Beyond Memorization

**21st century skills**: Employers value thinking, not just knowing

**Traditional education focus**:
```
Lower-order thinking (Bloom's Taxonomy):
- Remember: Recall facts
- Understand: Explain concepts

Example: "What is 8 × 7?" (memorization)
```

**Higher-order thinking needed**:
```
Upper levels (Bloom's Taxonomy):
- Apply: Use knowledge in new situations
- Analyze: Break down and examine
- Evaluate: Judge and critique
- Create: Design and invent

Example: "Design a garden that is 8 feet × 7 feet. What will you plant and why?" (application, analysis, creation)
```

**Research** (Marzano, 2010): Teaching critical thinking improves:
- Academic achievement: **25 percentile point gain**
- Transfer of learning: **40% better** application to new situations
- Problem-solving: **50% faster** at finding solutions

**Key principle**: Can't Google critical thinking (must develop through practice)

Problem: [Word problem presented]

Step 1: UNDERSTAND the problem
What are you trying to find?
_________________________________________________

What information do you know?
_________________________________________________

What information is missing or not needed?
_________________________________________________

Step 2: MAKE A PLAN
What strategy will you use?
☐ Draw a picture
☐ Make a table
☐ Look for a pattern

## Cause and Effect Analysis

**Understanding relationships**

### If-Then Scenarios

**Critical thinking worksheet**:
```
Cause and Effect Reasoning

Scenario: It is raining outside.

2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

Reverse thinking: What might have caused the rain? (Causes)
1. Dark clouds formed
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

Chain reactions: One effect becomes a cause

Rain → Grass grows → _____________ → _____________

Real-world application:
If I study hard (cause) → then ___________ (effect)
If I don't eat breakfast (cause) → then ___________ (effect)

Skills: Causal reasoning, prediction, understanding consequences
```

___ 5. The book is 200 pages long.
___ 6. This book is boring.

Explain: How can you tell the difference?
Fact: Can be proven true or false (evidence exists)
Opinion: Personal belief (may vary from person to person)

Challenge: Find an opinion piece (newspaper, ad, speech)
Identify: What is fact? What is opinion?

Persuasion analysis: Which words signal opinion?
- "best," "should," "always," "never," "everyone" (opinion clue words)

Skills: Critical reading, bias detection, evidence evaluation
```

Signal words that help:
- First, next, then, after that, finally
- Before, after, during

Extension: Write your own procedure that requires sequencing
Example: How to make a sandwich (must be in correct order)

Skills: Temporal reasoning, understanding sequence, process analysis
```
