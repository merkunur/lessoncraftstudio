        title: 'Select Hidden Objects for I Spy Worksheets and Counting Practice',
        description: `Start by selecting which theme matches your teaching goals. Browse categories including animals, food, vehicles, toys, household items, and nature. Click the theme dropdown to see all available options. The animals theme works perfectly for beginning kindergarten worksheets. Each theme contains dozens of related images organized alphabetically. All images feature bright colors and child-friendly illustrations.

Search for specific objects using the search box. Type any keyword to find matching images across all themes. The search works in all 11 supported languages. Results appear instantly as you type. Click any image thumbnail to select it as a hidden object. Selected images display a blue border to confirm your choice. You can select between 1 and 4 hidden objects total.

Upload your own photos if library images don't match your needs. Click the upload button to browse your device. Select multiple files at once for faster workflow. The system accepts JPEG, PNG, GIF, and other common formats. Uploaded images appear in a separate preview area. Click uploaded images to add them as hidden objects. Combine library images with uploaded photos in the same worksheet.

Clear your selection anytime to start over fresh. The clear button removes all selected hidden objects instantly. Your theme selection and search results remain unchanged. This lets you quickly try different object combinations. Most teachers select 2-3 hidden objects for balanced difficulty. Kindergarten worksheets work best with 2 objects for younger students. First grade worksheets can handle 3-4 objects for more challenge.`,

        title: 'Customize Grid Settings for Visual Discrimination Worksheets',
        description: `Set your grid dimensions using the row and column controls. Drag the sliders or type numbers directly into the boxes. Rows range from 5 to 10 for varying difficulty. Columns range from 5 to 10 as well. A 6×6 grid creates 36 total cells to fill. Larger grids make worksheets more challenging for students. Smaller grids work better for kindergarten worksheets introducing the activity.

Choose your page size from the dropdown menu. Letter portrait (8.5×11 inches) works for most classroom printers. A4 portrait fits European standard paper sizes. Landscape orientations provide wider worksheet layouts. Square formats create unique visual designs. Custom dimensions let you specify exact pixel measurements. The page size affects how large grid images appear. Math worksheets typically use letter portrait for consistent formatting.

Select background colors or decorative themes if desired. Click the page color picker to choose a solid background. Browse background themes for patterned or illustrated backgrounds. Adjust background opacity using the slider control. Border themes add decorative frames around worksheet edges. Border opacity controls how prominent the frame appears. Free printable worksheets look professional with subtle background colors.

Assign task types to each selected hidden object. Each object needs a circle, square, cross out, or count task. Click the dropdown next to each object's thumbnail. Select which action students should perform when finding that object. Circle tasks involve drawing circles around objects. Square tasks require drawing rectangular boxes. Cross out tasks mean drawing X marks. Count tasks ask students to write the total number found.

Mix different task types for varied skill practice. Use circle and square tasks for fine motor development. Add cross out tasks for hand-eye coordination. Include count tasks for math worksheet number practice. The variety keeps kindergarten worksheets engaging for multiple uses. Change task assignments anytime before generating the worksheet.`,

        description: `Click the Generate button to create your worksheet instantly. The system builds your grid in under 3 seconds. Hidden objects appear twice each throughout the grid. Other images from your selected theme fill remaining cells. The grid arranges images in random positions each time. A professional header displays "I Spy" or equivalent in your language. The header includes instructions for students automatically.

Review the generated worksheet on your screen. Zoom in and out using the zoom controls. The worksheet displays at actual print size. All images load in full color with clear details. Text appears crisp and readable at any zoom level. The layout automatically centers on the page. Grid cells maintain equal spacing for clean appearance. Your kindergarten worksheets look professionally designed without any effort.

Regenerate with one click if you want different image placement. The regenerate button keeps your settings but creates a new random arrangement. Hidden objects move to different grid positions. New filler images replace the previous ones. This gives you unlimited variations from the same settings. Create fresh first grade worksheets daily without repeating layouts. Your Core Bundle subscription allows unlimited regeneration attempts.

Add custom text anywhere on the canvas after generation. Click the text tool and type your desired message. Position text at top, bottom, or sides of the worksheet. Change font size to make text larger or smaller. Pick from seven child-friendly font options. Adjust text color to match your theme. Add student name lines for personalization. Text tools work identically on kindergarten worksheets and answer keys.

Preview the automatic answer key before downloading. Click the Answer Key tab to switch views. The answer key shows visual indicators for each hidden object. Circles, squares, crosses, or numbers mark where objects appear. The answer key matches your worksheet layout exactly. Both tabs remain editable for customization. Switch between tabs anytime during the editing process.`,

        title: 'Edit Your Hidden Object Worksheets and Math Worksheets on Canvas',
        description: `Click any element on the canvas to select it. Selected objects display corner handles and a rotation control. Drag objects to new positions anywhere on the page. Images can overlap or spread out as needed. The drag function works smoothly for quick repositioning. Move text, borders, backgrounds, and grid images freely. Everything stays editable even after worksheet generation completes.

Resize objects using the corner handles. Drag corners outward to make images larger. Pull corners inward to shrink images smaller. Hold Shift while dragging to maintain proportions. Release Shift to stretch width or height independently. Resize individual grid images for emphasis. Make hidden objects slightly larger as hints. Adjust text size for better readability on kindergarten worksheets.

Rotate any object using the rotation handle. Click the circular arrow icon above selected objects. Drag the handle clockwise or counterclockwise. Images rotate smoothly to any angle. Tilted images add visual interest to free printable worksheets. Rotate text for creative header designs. Grid images can tilt for a playful appearance. Reset rotation by typing 0 in the angle field.

Delete unwanted elements with the delete button or keyboard key. Select objects you want to remove. Press Delete or click the trash icon. Deleted items disappear immediately from the canvas. The undo button reverses accidental deletions. Redo restores deleted items if you change your mind. Remove grid images to create easier worksheets. Delete backgrounds or borders for simpler designs.

Layer controls adjust which objects appear in front. Select an object and click Bring to Front. That object moves above all others on the canvas. Send to Back pushes objects behind everything else. Bring Forward and Send Backward move objects one layer at a time. Proper layering makes text readable over images. Math worksheets benefit from clear text hierarchy.

Lock objects to prevent accidental changes. Click the lock icon after positioning elements perfectly. Locked objects cannot move, resize, or rotate. They remain selectable but not editable. Unlock individual objects when you need to adjust them. The Unlock All button quickly releases all locked items. Locking works great for backgrounds and borders on first grade worksheets.`,
