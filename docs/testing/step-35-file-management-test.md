curl -X POST /api/files/upload \
  -F "files[]=@file1.jpg" \
  -F "files[]=@file2.jpg"
```

✅ Search and filtering work
✅ Sharing generates links
✅ Permissions enforced
✅ Versioning tracks changes
✅ Storage quota accurate
✅ CDN serves files
✅ Workflows execute

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Upload fails for large files
- Check chunk size settings
- Verify timeout configuration
- Review memory limits
- Check disk space

### Issue: Preview not working
- Check MIME type detection
- Verify preview generators
- Review CORS settings
- Check file permissions

### Issue: CDN not serving files
- Verify CDN configuration
- Check cache headers
- Review origin settings
- Test CDN endpoints

### Issue: Storage quota incorrect
- Recalculate usage
- Check for orphaned files
- Review calculation logic
- Sync with providers

### Issue: Sharing links broken
- Check URL generation

- Review access tokens
- Test permissions

## Best Practices
1. Use chunked uploads for large files
2. Implement virus scanning
3. Set appropriate cache headers
4. Use CDN for static assets
5. Regular backup to cloud storage
6. Monitor storage usage
7. Implement access logging
8. Use signed URLs for security

## Storage Optimization
1. **Compression**: Auto-compress text files
2. **Deduplication**: Detect duplicate files
3. **Tiered Storage**: Hot/cold storage tiers
4. **Lifecycle Policies**: Auto-archive old files
5. **Format Optimization**: Convert to efficient formats
6. **Lazy Loading**: Load files on demand
7. **Edge Caching**: Cache at CDN edge
8. **Bandwidth Throttling**: Limit transfer speeds

## Next Steps
