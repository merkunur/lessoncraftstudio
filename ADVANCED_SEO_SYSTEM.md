### **4. LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) Keyword Extraction**

**Semantic SEO for Modern Search Engines**

Google doesn't just look for exact keyword matches anymore. It understands TOPICS and CONTEXT.

**What We Do:**
1. Extract all significant words from your content
2. Filter out 100+ common stop words
3. Calculate frequency of each meaningful term
4. Identify top 10 related keywords (excluding your focus keyword)
5. Display frequency count for each term

**Why This Matters:**
- Modern search engines use semantic analysis
- Related keywords = topical authority
- Better context understanding = higher rankings
- Avoids keyword stuffing while maintaining relevance

**Example:**
- **Focus Keyword**: "math worksheets"
- **LSI Keywords Detected**: practice (12×), students (10×), addition (8×), printable (7×), grade (6×)

These related terms show Google your content comprehensively covers the topic.

---

### **5. Schema Markup Generator (Rich Snippets)**

**Automatic JSON-LD Generation for 3 Schema Types:**

**A. Article Schema**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Your optimized meta title",
  "description": "Your meta description",
  "image": "Featured image URL",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "LessonCraftStudio"

  "publisher": {...},
  "datePublished": "ISO timestamp",

1. **H1 Count** - Must be exactly 1 per page

4. **Total Headings** - Overall structure assessment
