        title: 'Choose Difficulty and Operations for Your Free Worksheet for Kids',
        description: 'Start by selecting your difficulty level from the dropdown menu. Very Easy and Easy create two-symbol puzzles perfect for kindergarten worksheets. Medium difficulty uses three symbols for first grade students. Hard level creates four-symbol puzzles for advanced second and third graders. Next, choose your math operations. Select "Addition Only" for students just learning to add. This works great for kindergarten worksheets focused on basic number sense. Choose "Addition & Subtraction" for first grade worksheets that practice both operations. The generator mixes both operations randomly in each puzzle. Set your number range using the minimum and maximum value fields. Default settings use 0 to 20, perfect for printable math worksheets for early elementary. Increase the maximum to 50 or 100 for challenging addition worksheets. Lower ranges work better for kindergarten students still learning single-digit numbers. Check "Allow negative results" if teaching subtraction that crosses zero. Most kindergarten worksheets leave this unchecked. First grade worksheets might enable it for advanced students. The number range directly affects puzzle difficulty in your printable worksheets. Select how many exercises to include on each worksheet. Choose 1-6 puzzles depending on student age and attention span. Two to three puzzles work well for kindergarten worksheets. Four to six puzzles fit nicely on first grade worksheets for homework or morning work.',
