## Introduction: Assessment FOR Learning vs OF Learning

**Two assessment types**:
- **Summative assessment**: Assessment OF learning (final test, measures what students learned)
- **Formative assessment**: Assessment FOR learning (ongoing checks, guides instruction)

**Research** (Black & Wiliam, 1998): Formative assessment improves student achievement by **0.4-0.7 standard deviations** (equivalent to moving from 50th percentile to 66th-77th percentile)

**Traditional assessment problem**:
```
Week 1-3: Teach addition
Week 4: Test (summative assessment)
Result: Discover on test that 30% of students didn't understand
Problem: Too late - already moved to next unit
Consequence: Students fall behind (gaps accumulate)
```

**Formative assessment solution**:
```
Week 1 Day 1: Teach addition concept
Week 1 Day 2: Quick worksheet check (5 problems)
Week 1 Day 2 (afternoon): Analyze results
Week 1 Day 3: Reteach students who struggled (intervention)
Week 1 Day 4: Check again (progress monitoring)
Result: Catch misunderstandings DURING learning (prevent gaps)
```

**Key difference**: Formative = DURING instruction (can adjust), Summative = AFTER instruction (too late)

---

## Daily Progress Monitoring System

**Concept**: Brief daily checks (5-10 minutes) track learning in real-time

### The 5-Problem Check-In

**Structure**:
```
Daily mini-worksheet (generated in 42 seconds):
- 5 problems testing current skill
- Students complete in 5 minutes
- Teacher scores in 5 minutes
- Total time: 10 minutes (includes instruction adjustment)
```

**Example: Week teaching 2-digit addition**

**Monday mini-check**:
```
5 problems: 2-digit addition without regrouping
Results:
- 20 students: 5/5 correct (mastery)
- 7 students: 3-4/5 correct (emerging)
- 3 students: 0-2/5 correct (not understanding)

Action:
- Tuesday: Whole class advances to regrouping
- Tuesday small group: 3 struggling students get reteaching (non-regrouping review)
```

**Tuesday mini-check**:
```
5 problems: 2-digit addition WITH regrouping
Results:
- 15 students: 5/5 correct (ready to advance)
- 10 students: 2-4/5 correct (need more practice)
- 5 students: 0-1/5 correct (significant struggle)

Action:
- Wednesday: 15 students do independent practice (enrichment)
- Wednesday: Teacher works with group of 15 needing practice
- Intervention teacher pulls 5 for intensive reteaching
```

**Benefit**: Catch struggles BEFORE they become gaps (responsive teaching)

---

## Error Pattern Analysis

**Beyond right/wrong**: Analyze HOW students are making mistakes

### Math Error Patterns

**Addition regrouping errors**:

**Pattern 1: Forget to regroup**
```
  47
+ 28
----
  65  (incorrect - student added 7+8=15, wrote 5, forgot to carry 1)

Diagnosis: Understands addition, forgets regrouping step
Intervention: Visual regrouping practice (show carrying explicitly)
```

**Pattern 2: Regroup incorrectly**
```
  47
+ 28
----
  75  (incorrect - student carried 1 correctly but added it to wrong place)

Diagnosis: Understands regrouping needed, executes incorrectly
Intervention: Place value review (which column is which?)
```

**Pattern 3: Random errors (no pattern)**
```
Sometimes correct, sometimes wrong (inconsistent)

Diagnosis: Careless errors OR working memory overload
Intervention: Reduce problem count (fewer at a time), check work strategy
```

**Generator advantage**: Create targeted practice for specific error types
```
Generate worksheet: 20 problems specifically requiring regrouping
Focus: Does student ALWAYS forget to regroup, or just sometimes?
Data: If 0/20 correct = skill deficit, if 12/20 correct = inconsistency issue
```

---

## RTI (Response to Intervention) Progress Monitoring

**RTI framework**: 3-tier support system

**Tier 1**: Core instruction (all students)
**Tier 2**: Targeted intervention (struggling students, 20-30% of class)
**Tier 3**: Intensive intervention (significant struggles, 5-10% of class)

---

### Tier 2 Progress Monitoring Protocol

**Frequency**: Weekly worksheet checks (track intervention effectiveness)

**Example: Student struggling with multiplication facts**

**Week 1 baseline**:
```
Generate: 25 multiplication facts (0-10)
Student score: 8/25 correct (32%)
Decision: Qualify for Tier 2 intervention
```

**Weeks 2-8: Intervention + weekly monitoring**
```
Week 2: Generate fresh worksheet (25 facts, same skill)
        Score: 10/25 (40%) - slight improvement
        Continue intervention

Week 3: Score: 12/25 (48%) - continued growth
        Continue intervention

Week 4: Score: 11/25 (44%) - slight drop
        Adjust intervention (try different strategy)

Week 5: Score: 15/25 (60%) - improvement after adjustment
        Continue intervention

Week 6: Score: 17/25 (68%) - steady progress
        Continue intervention

Week 7: Score: 20/25 (80%) - approaching mastery
        Continue intervention (almost there)

Week 8: Score: 22/25 (88%) - mastery achieved!
        Decision: Exit Tier 2, return to Tier 1 only
```

**Generator value**: Create fresh assessment each week (no memorization, true skill measure)

**Documentation**: 8 worksheets in folder (proof of progress for IEP/RTI team)

---

### Tier 3 Progress Monitoring Protocol

**Frequency**: Twice weekly (intensive monitoring)

**Shorter assessments**: 10 problems (less overwhelming)

**Example: Student with significant math deficits**

**Week 1**:
```
Monday: 10 single-digit addition problems
        Score: 3/10 (30%)

Thursday: 10 single-digit addition (different problems)
          Score: 4/10 (40%) - progress within week!
```

**Week 2**:
```
Monday: Score: 5/10 (50%)
Thursday: Score: 6/10 (60%)
Trend: Consistent growth
```

**Benefit**: Twice-weekly data shows intervention working (or not working if plateau)

---

## Data-Driven Instruction Cycle

**Concept**: Use assessment data to adjust instruction continuously

### The Weekly Cycle

**Friday**: Analyze week's data
```
Review all daily 5-problem checks:
- Which students mastered skill? (ready to advance)
- Which students need more practice? (not quite there)
- Which students didn't understand? (need reteaching)
```

**Sunday**: Plan next week based on data
```
Group 1 (mastered): Generate enrichment worksheets (advanced application)
Group 2 (emerging): Generate more practice worksheets (same skill, more reps)
Group 3 (struggling): Generate modified worksheets (simplified, scaffolded)
```

**Monday-Friday**: Deliver differentiated instruction
```
All groups: Working on appropriate level materials
Teacher: Circulates, provides targeted support where needed
```

**Next Friday**: Analyze again, regroup as needed

**Result**: Instruction continuously responsive to student needs

---

## Goal Setting & Tracking

**Student ownership**: Make progress visible

### Individual Progress Charts

**Setup**:
```
Student folder:
- Weekly graph (track % correct each week)
- Goal line (where student wants to be)
- Actual performance line (where student is)
```

**Example: Multiplication fact fluency**

**Student goal**: 90% accuracy by end of month

**Week-by-week tracking**:
```
Week 1: 32% (baseline)
Week 2: 40% (+8%)
Week 3: 48% (+8%)
Week 4: 60% (+12%) - accelerating!
Week 5: 72% (+12%)
Week 6: 85% (+13%)
Week 7: 92% (+7%) - GOAL EXCEEDED!
```

**Benefit**: Student sees own growth (motivation), teacher documents progress (accountability)

---

## Classroom Data Wall (Confidential)

**Purpose**: Teacher tracking (NOT public student display)

**Setup**:
```
Private teacher bulletin board (or digital spreadsheet):

Skill: 2-digit addition with regrouping

Student names (or codes) | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Weekly Trend
Student A                 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | Mastered ✓
Student B                 | 3/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | Mastered ✓
Student C                 | 2/5 | 2/5 | 3/5 | 3/5 | 4/5 | Emerging (needs more practice)
Student D                 | 1/5 | 0/5 | 1/5 | 2/5 | 2/5 | Struggling (intervention needed)
...
```

**At-a-glance information**: Which students need what support

---

## Efficient Scoring Strategies

**Problem**: Scoring 30 students daily = time burden

**Solutions**:

### Strategy 1: Student Self-Scoring (with answer key)

**Process**:
```
1. Students complete 5-problem check (5 min)
2. Teacher projects answer key (1 min)
3. Students score own work, mark X on incorrect (2 min)
4. Students write score at top (30 seconds)
5. Turn in to teacher

Teacher: Quickly scan scores (2 min), note who needs support
Total time: 10.5 minutes (vs 20+ minutes if teacher scores all)
```

**Benefit**: Student accountability (see own mistakes immediately), time-efficient

---

### Strategy 2: Peer Scoring (with partner)

**Process**:
```
1. Students complete worksheet (5 min)
2. Trade with partner
3. Teacher projects answer key
4. Partners score each other's work (2 min)
5. Return papers, discuss mistakes (1 min)
6. Turn in to teacher

Total time: 8 minutes, includes built-in peer discussion
```

---

### Strategy 3: Digital Submission (Google Classroom)

**Process**:
```
1. Students complete worksheet (5 min)
2. Take photo, submit to Google Classroom (2 min)
3. Teacher grades digitally when convenient (after school, prep period)

Benefit: No class time spent scoring
```

---

## Intervention Planning Based on Data

**Data informs intervention decisions**

### Scenario 1: Whole-Class Struggle

**Data**: 80% of class scored below 60% on Friday check

**Diagnosis**: Instruction ineffective (most students didn't get it)

**Action**:
- **Monday**: Reteach ENTIRE concept (different approach)
- **Tuesday**: Practice (new worksheet)
- **Wednesday**: Check again (5-problem assessment)
- **Result**: If still low, try ANOTHER teaching method (seek support)

---

### Scenario 2: Small Group Struggle

**Data**: 5 students consistently scoring below 60%, rest of class 85%+

**Diagnosis**: Small group needs targeted support (not whole-class issue)

**Action**:
- **Pull-out intervention**: 20 minutes daily with special ed teacher or interventionist
- **Modified worksheets**: Reduced problem count (10 instead of 20), picture support
- **Daily progress monitoring**: Track these 5 students daily (vs weekly for others)

---

### Scenario 3: Individual Student Outlier

**Data**: One student scoring 0-20% while all others 70%+

**Diagnosis**: Significant skill deficit OR other factor (vision, attention, processing)

**Action**:
- **Referral**: RTI team meeting, possible evaluation for special education
- **Immediate accommodation**: Modified materials, 1-on-1 support
- **Diagnostic assessment**: Identify WHERE understanding broke down (place value? number sense?)

---

## Progress Monitoring for IEP Goals

**IEP requirement**: Document progress toward goals

**Example IEP goal**: "Student will solve 2-digit addition problems with 80% accuracy"

**Weekly monitoring**:
```
Week 1: Generate 10-problem worksheet
        Score: 4/10 (40%)
        Progress: Below goal

Week 2: Generate new worksheet (same skill)
        Score: 5/10 (50%)
        Progress: Improving

Week 3: Score: 6/10 (60%)
        Progress: Continued growth

Week 4: Score: 7/10 (70%)
        Progress: Approaching goal

Week 5: Score: 8/10 (80%)
        Progress: GOAL MET ✓

IEP documentation: 5 worksheets showing progress from 40% → 80%
```

**Generator advantage**: Fresh problems each week (valid assessment), quick creation (42 seconds each)

---

## Time Investment: Formative Assessment System
