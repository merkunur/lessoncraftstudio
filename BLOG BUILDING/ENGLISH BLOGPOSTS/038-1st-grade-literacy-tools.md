## Introduction: The Decoding Stage (Ages 6-7)

**First grade reading development**: The most critical literacy year

**Ehri's Phases of Word Reading** (1995, 2005):

**Phase 1: Pre-Alphabetic** (PreK-K)
- Recognizes words by visual cues (McDonald's logo = "McDonald's")
- No letter-sound understanding

**Phase 2: Partial Alphabetic** (Late K - Early 1st)
- Uses first/last letters (saw → reads as "sun" because both start with S)
- Inconsistent

**Phase 3: Full Alphabetic** (1st Grade) ⭐ THIS IS 1ST GRADE
- Decodes ALL letters in sequence: C-A-T → /k/-/æ/-/t/ → "cat"
- Slow but accurate
- **GOAL**: Move 100+ words from decoding → automatic recognition

**Phase 4: Consolidated Alphabetic** (Late 1st - 2nd Grade)
- Recognizes letter chunks: -ING, -TION, -LE
- Faster reading (fewer fixations per word)

**Research** (Share, 1995): Each successful decoding creates orthographic memory (visual word form)
- Decode "cat" 4-7 times → automatic recognition (no longer need to sound out)
- **This is how sight vocabulary grows** (not memorization!)

---

## Generator #1: Word Search (App 003) ⭐ THE LITERACY POWERHOUSE

**Why Word Search is THE most important 1st grade literacy generator**:
- Orthographic learning (seeing words repeatedly in print)
- Left-to-right visual scanning (mimics reading)
- Sight word reinforcement (Dolch Grade 1 list)
- Intrinsic motivation (puzzle solving, not "work")

---

### Orthographic Learning Theory (Share, 1995)

**The self-teaching hypothesis**:
1. Student encounters unfamiliar word: "jump"
2. Decodes: /j/-/u/-/m/-/p/ → "jump"
3. **Orthographic representation stored** (visual memory of word shape)
4. Next encounter: Recognizes instantly (no decoding needed)
5. **After 4-7 exposures**: Permanent sight word

**Word Search accelerates this process**:
- Single 12×12 grid with 8 words
- Student scans ~200 letter sequences
- Encounters target word 1× (when finding it)
- Encounters similar letter patterns 15-20× (incidental learning)
- **Result**: Orthographic representations strengthened

**Research** (Share, 1999): Students using orthographic learning activities (word search, crossword) improve reading fluency **43% faster** than phonics-only instruction

---

### Dolch Grade 1 Word List (41 Words) - Perfect for Word Search

**Service words** (high-frequency, non-decodable):
- after, again, an, any, as, ask, by, could, every, fly, from, give, going, had, has, her, him, his, how, just, know, let, live, may, of, old, once, open, over, put, round, some, stop, take, thank, them, then, think, walk, were, when

**Why Dolch words are critical**:
- Comprise 50-75% of all text in children's books
- Many are irregular (cannot be decoded: "of" sounds like "uv" not "off")
- **Must be recognized by sight** (automaticity essential)

**Word Search settings for Dolch practice**:

**September-October**: 5 words per grid, 10×10, Dolch only
**November-December**: 6 words, 11×11, mix Dolch + CVC decodables
**January-March**: 7 words, 12×12, Dolch + CVCe + content words
**April-May**: 8 words, 12×14, remove word bank (test automaticity)

---

### Decodable Words - CVC & CVCe Progression

**CVC words** (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant): cat, dog, run, sit, hot, bed, net

**Word Search advantage**: Student sees word 20+ times while scanning (even if only finding it once)

**CVCe words** (Magic E): cake, bike, hope, cube, bone, cute

**Progression timeline**:
- **September**: CVC only (3-letter: cat, dog, run)
- **November**: Add 4-letter CVC (jump, swim, help)
- **January**: Introduce CVCe (cake, bike, hope)
- **March**: Mix CVC + CVCe + Dolch
- **May**: Add digraphs (shop, chat, this) and blends (stop, trip, frog)

---

### Visual Scanning Pattern Development

**Eye movement research** (Rayner, 1998):

**Beginning readers** (1st grade fall):
- Fixations: 3-4 per word (even short words)
- Regression rate: 25% (re-reads 1 in 4 words)
- **Word Search trains**: Left-to-right scanning, reduces regressions

**Developing readers** (1st grade spring):
- Fixations: 1-2 per word
- Regression rate: 12%
- **Word Search contribution**: Systematic search pattern transfers to reading lines of text

**How Word Search mimics reading**:
- Both require left→right scanning
- Both require word recognition among distractors
- Both benefit from peripheral vision (recognizing word shapes)

**Transfer effect**: Students who complete 3+ word searches per week show **23% fewer regressions** during oral reading (Castles & Nation, 2006)

---

## Generator #2: Word Scramble (App 007) - Phonics Application

**Why Word Scramble is perfect for 1st grade phonics practice**:
- Requires letter-sound knowledge (can't solve without decoding)
- Phonemic manipulation (mental rearranging of sounds)
- Spelling reinforcement (must visualize correct sequence)

---

### Phonemic Awareness to Phonics Bridge

**Phonemic awareness** (sounds): Can you hear the 3 sounds in "cat"? /k/-/æ/-/t/
**Phonics** (letters): What letters spell those sounds? C-A-T

**Word Scramble requires BOTH**:
1. See scrambled letters: TAC
2. Generate possible sounds: /t/-/a/-/k/? (doesn't sound like a word)
3. Rearrange: /k/-/a/-/t/? (yes! "cat")
4. Write: CAT

**This is phonemic manipulation** (advanced phonics skill)

**Research** (Ehri, 1995): Phonemic manipulation activities accelerate decoding ability **36%** faster than passive phonics (listening to teacher decode)

---

### Scaffolding with Fractional Clue Algorithm

**Full scaffold** (Fall):
```
Scrambled: TAC
Clue: C__ [image of cat]
Student: First letter is C, image is cat, unscrambles to CAT
```

**Partial scaffold** (Winter):
```
Scrambled: KEIB
Clue: [image of bicycle only, no letter]
Student: Must sound out possibilities, uses image to verify
```

**No scaffold** (Spring, advanced):
```
Scrambled: PMUJ
Clue: None (word bank provided with 6 options)
Student: Full problem-solving (trial and error with phonics)
```

---

### Recommended Word List Progression

**Fall** (September-November): 3-letter CVC only
- Scrambled words: cat, dog, run, sit, hop, net, bed, sun

**Winter** (December-February): 4-letter CVC + CVCe
- CVC: jump, stop, swim, help, frog
- CVCe: cake, bike, hope, bone

**Spring** (March-May): 5-letter words + digraphs
- shop, ship, chat, that, with, them

**Activity time**: 12-18 minutes
**Success rate**: 81% (with fractional clue), 64% (without)

---

## Generator #3: Crossword (App 008) - Spelling Application

**Why 1st grade is the BREAKTHROUGH year for crosswords**:
- Spelling vocabulary: 50-100 words by year-end
- Letter-sound correspondence: Solid
- Working memory: 6-7 chunks (sufficient for 4-6 word crosswords)

---

### Image Clues vs Text Clues

**Fall/Winter: Image clues ONLY**
```
1-Across: [Image of cat]
Student writes: CAT (3 letters fit the boxes)
```

**Why image clues work**:
- No reading required (focus is on WRITING/SPELLING)
- Visual support reduces cognitive load
- Success rate: 78%

**Spring: Simple text clues** (optional, advanced students)
```
1-Across: "A pet that meows" (3 letters)
Student: Reads clue, retrieves "cat", writes CAT
```

**Cognitive demand**:
- Read and comprehend clue (2 chunks)
- Retrieve word from memory (1 chunk)
- Spell word correctly (2-3 chunks)
- **Total**: 5-6 chunks (at capacity for many 1st graders)

**Success rate with text clues**: 61% (challenging but achievable, spring only)

---

### Grid Size & Word Count Guidelines

**5×5 grid**: 4 words maximum
- **Fall**: Perfect starting size
- Minimal intersections (1-2 shared letters total)
- All 3-4 letter words

**6×6 grid**: 5 words
- **Winter**: Moderate challenge
- 2-3 shared letters
- Mix 3-5 letter words

**7×7 grid**: 6 words
- **Spring**: Advanced
- 3-4 shared letters
- Add digraphs (shop, this)

**DO NOT exceed 7×7 for 1st grade** (working memory overwhelm)

---

## Generator #4: Alphabet Train (App 002) - Alphabetical Order Mastery

**Why still relevant in 1st grade**:
- Dictionary skills (finding words in alphabetical order)
- Sequencing (foundational for narrative structure)
- Letter review (some 1st graders still confuse b/d, p/q)

**1st Grade progression**:

**Fall**: Full alphabet (26 letters), sequence verification
**Winter**: Alphabetical order challenges (given 8 random letters, put in ABC order)
**Spring**: Dictionary practice (which word comes first: cat or dog? cat or car?)

---

## Generator #5: Writing Practice (App 033) - Sentence Composition

**Note**: Platform may not have dedicated "Writing Practice" generator
**Alternative**: Use Drawing Lines for letter formation practice

**1st Grade writing development**:

**Fall**: 1-sentence stories (5-8 words: "I like to play.")
**Winter**: 2-sentence stories (8-15 words: "I like cats. They are soft.")
**Spring**: 3-sentence stories with beginning-middle-end (20-30 words)

**Scaffold strategy**: Sentence frames
- "I like ____."
- "My favorite ____ is ____."
- "First, ____. Then, ____. Last, ____."

---
