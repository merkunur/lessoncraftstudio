## Methodology

### Keyword Pattern (Framework Rule 4)

Theme+grade pages own: `{theme} worksheets {grade}`, `{theme} {grade} activities`, `{theme} worksheets for {age}`

Each primary keyword includes:
1. **Theme name** — the theme's core subject
2. **Grade modifier** — preschool, kindergarten, first/second/third grade, or ages X-Y
3. **Skill differentiator** — a grade-appropriate skill that distinguishes siblings within the same theme

### Title Template

```
{Theme} {Grade} Worksheets — {Specific Skill/Benefit} | LCS
```

- Target: 50-60 characters total
- Uses `| LCS` (not full `| LessonCraftStudio`) to fit within character budget
- Em dash (`—`) separates keyword phrase from skill qualifier

### Description Template

```
Free printable {theme} worksheets for {grade} (ages {range}). {Skill-focus-sentence}. Download {theme}-themed {activity-types}.
```

- Target: 150-160 characters total
- Primary keyword appears within first 60 characters
- Each description has a unique middle sentence reflecting the focus skill

### Grade Skill Differentiation

Within each theme, the 5 grade pages target different developmental skills:

| Grade | Age | Typical Focus Skills |
|-------|-----|---------------------|
| Preschool | 3-4 | Counting to 10, color recognition, tracing, sorting, matching |
| Kindergarten | 5-6 | Counting to 20, letter sounds, patterns, comparison, vocabulary |
| First Grade | 6-7 | Addition/subtraction, reading, word problems, basic science |
| Second Grade | 7-8 | Multi-digit math, reading comprehension, data, graphing |
| Third Grade | 8-9 | Multiplication, fractions, research writing, analysis |
