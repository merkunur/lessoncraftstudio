## Cannibalization Resolution Verification

All 6 cannibalization groups identified in the Part 1 audit are resolved:

### Group 1: "addition worksheets" — RESOLVED

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `addition-worksheets` | addition worksheets | addition worksheet generator | Rule 2 |
| `code-addition-worksheets` | addition worksheets | picture addition worksheet maker | Rule 2 + Rule 8 |

**Resolution:** Different action modifiers (generator vs maker) + "picture" qualifier on code-addition. Zero keyword overlap.

### Group 2: "free worksheet" (generic) — RESOLVED

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `alphabet-train-worksheets` | free worksheet | alphabet train worksheet generator | Rule 2 + Rule 7 |
| `big-small-worksheets` | free worksheet | big and small worksheet maker | Rule 2 + Rule 7 |

**Resolution:** Generic "free worksheet" replaced with specific tool-action keywords containing the app's unique subject. Rule 7 ensures "free" appears only as a modifier paired with a specific qualifier.

### Group 3: "coloring worksheets" — RESOLVED

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `coloring-worksheets` | coloring worksheets | coloring page generator for kids | Rule 2 |
| `draw-and-color-worksheets` | coloring worksheets | grid drawing worksheet maker | Rule 2 + Rule 8 |

**Resolution:** Entirely different tool concepts — "coloring page generator" vs "grid drawing worksheet maker". Not just modifier differentiation but completely different subject matter.

### Group 4: "matching worksheets" — RESOLVED

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `matching-worksheets` | matching worksheets | matching worksheet generator | Rule 2 |
| Category hub `/matching-sorting` | matching worksheets | matching and sorting worksheet tools | Rule 6 |

**Resolution:** Product page gets singular tool-action "generator"; category hub gets plural browsing term "tools". Different intent territories (transactional vs browse).

### Group 5: "math worksheets" — RESOLVED

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `math-worksheets` | math worksheets | math worksheet generator with pictures | Rule 2 |
| Category hub `/math` | math worksheets | math worksheet generators for teachers | Rule 6 |

**Resolution:** Product page adds feature qualifier "with pictures"; category hub adds audience qualifier "for teachers". Different intent plus different qualifier.

### Group 6: "pattern worksheets" — RESOLVED

| Page | Old Primary | New Primary | Rule |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `pattern-worksheets` | pattern worksheets | pattern recognition worksheet maker | Rule 2 |
| `pattern-train-worksheets` | pattern worksheets | pattern train worksheet generator | Rule 2 + Rule 8 |
| Category hub `/patterns-motor` | pattern worksheets | pattern and motor skills worksheet tools | Rule 6 |

**Resolution:** Three-way split using different tool concepts (recognition vs train format), different action modifiers (maker vs generator), and different intent levels (tool vs browse).
