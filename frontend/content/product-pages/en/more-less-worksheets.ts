        question: 'What Comparison Types Does the Generator Offer?',
        answer: 'Two comparison types address different developmental stages. Image-to-image mode shows two groups of pictures that students count and compare. Image-to-number mode displays a picture group alongside a written numeral for comparison. Image-to-image suits concrete learners who need visual counting. Image-to-number bridges the gap toward abstract number comparison skills.',
      },
      {
        id: '2',
        question: 'What Comparison Symbols Are Available?',
        answer: 'Three symbol options cover different instructional approaches. Standard mathematical symbols use greater than, less than, and equal signs. Illustrated versions display kid-friendly visual representations of these concepts. Teachers can focus on individual symbols for targeted practice or use comprehensive mode covering all three symbols on one worksheet. This flexibility supports various math curriculum approaches.',
      },

        id: '3',
        question: 'How Many Comparison Exercises Fit on One Worksheet?',
        answer: 'Customize from 1 to 8 comparison exercises per worksheet. One to two exercises provide large image groups with ample space for kindergarteners learning the concept. Four to five exercises suit standard kindergarten through first grade practice. Six to eight exercises create comprehensive review worksheets for students practicing comparison fluency.

      {
        id: '5',
        question: 'Can I Focus on One Comparison Symbol at a Time?',
        answer: 'Yes, select individual symbol focus to create worksheets practicing only greater than, only less than, or only equal to comparisons. This targeted approach lets teachers introduce each concept separately before combining all three symbols. After students master individual symbols, switch to comprehensive mode where all three appear on the same worksheet for mixed practice.',

        question: 'What Age Groups Benefit from Comparison Worksheets?',
        answer: 'Comparison worksheets serve ages 4 through 8 across preschool through second grade. Preschoolers ages 4 to 5 compare two small image groups visually with teacher guidance. Kindergarteners ages 5 to 6 use image-to-image mode with standard symbols independently. First graders transition to image-to-number comparisons. Second graders practice all comparison types for fluency and standardized test preparation.',
      },
      {
        id: '7',
        question: 'Are Comparison Worksheets Appropriate for Kindergarten?',
        answer: 'Comparison worksheets are core kindergarten math activities. Use image-to-image mode with 3 to 4 exercises per page for age-appropriate difficulty. Start with individual symbol focus to introduce greater than and less than concepts separately. Illustrated symbol versions help kindergarteners understand the directional meaning of comparison symbols. These worksheets directly support kindergarten math standards for comparing quantities.',
      },
      {
        id: '8',
        question: 'How Do Illustrated Symbols Help Young Learners?',
        answer: 'Illustrated comparison symbols use visual representations that convey meaning beyond abstract mathematical notation. Kid-friendly illustrations show the concept of bigger, smaller, or same size in ways young learners intuitively understand. Students connect the visual meaning to the mathematical symbol, building conceptual understanding before memorizing abstract notation. This scaffolded approach produces stronger long-term symbol comprehension.',

      {
        id: '17',
        question: 'How Does Image-to-Number Mode Bridge to Abstract Math?',
        answer: 'Image-to-number mode presents a picture group alongside a written numeral for comparison. Students count the images, then compare their count to the displayed number. This format bridges concrete counting and abstract number comparison by requiring students to translate between representations. Mastering this transition prepares students for fully abstract number comparison without visual supports.',

      {
        id: '18',
        question: 'How Do Comparison Worksheets Build Number Sense?',
        answer: 'Comparison worksheets develop number sense by requiring students to evaluate quantity relationships. Students practice judging whether groups are larger, smaller, or equal, building magnitude awareness. Repeated comparison practice develops intuitive understanding of number relationships that supports mental math estimation and reasonableness checking in later mathematical problem-solving.',

      {
        id: '19',
        question: 'How Do Comparison Worksheets Pair with Other Activities?',
        answer: 'Comparison worksheets pair naturally with addition and subtraction worksheets for comprehensive math instruction, big and small worksheets for size comparison connections, and pattern worksheets for mathematical reasoning development.

        id: '20',
        question: 'Can Comparison Worksheets Be Used for Assessment?',
        answer: 'Comparison worksheets serve as effective informal math assessments. Administer worksheets with all three comparison symbols to evaluate student mastery of greater than, less than, and equal to concepts. Track which symbol types students find most challenging. Use image-to-image for concrete assessment and image-to-number for abstract comparison assessment. Score efficiently using the provided answer keys.',
