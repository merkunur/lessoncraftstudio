## The Universal 3-Step Workflow

Every generator on LessonCraftStudio.com follows the same process:

**Step 1: Configure Settings** (30-60 seconds)
**Step 2: Auto-Generate** (3-10 seconds)
**Step 3: Edit & Export** (60-90 seconds)

**Total: 3 minutes or less**

Let's walk through a real example: creating a differentiated word scramble for 2nd grade.

---

## Step 1: Configure Settings (30-60 seconds)

### Choose Your Generator

For this tutorial: **Word Scramble Generator**

**Available in**: Core Bundle ($144/year), Full Access ($240/year)
**Not in**: Free tier (only Word Search)

**[See pricing tiers →](https://www.lessoncraftstudio.com/pricing)**

---

### Enter Your Content

**For Word Scramble**: Type spelling words (one per line)

```
rainbow
umbrella
thunder
lightning
puddle
cloudy
```

**Time**: 20 seconds

**Pro tip**: Keep word lists in Google Doc organized by week for instant copy-paste.

---

### Choose Difficulty Level

Word Scramble offers **4 levels** using fractional clue algorithm:

1. **No Clues**: Blank grids (advanced spellers)
2. **Easy (1/2 revealed)**: Shows half the letters
3. **Normal (1/4 revealed)**: Strategic hints
4. **Tough (1/6 revealed)**: Minimal support

**Tutorial example**: Select "Easy" for 2nd graders.

---

### Optional: Enable Images & Color-Coding

- **Images**: Pairs weather pictures with words (dual coding)
- **Color vowels**: Highlights vowels blue, consonants black (phonics)

**Tutorial example**: Enable both.

---

### Select Orientation

- Portrait (vertical layout)
- Landscape (horizontal layout)

**Tutorial example**: Portrait.

**Time elapsed: 45 seconds**

---

## Step 2: Auto-Generate (3-10 seconds)

### Click "Generate Worksheet"

**What happens** (algorithm runs in 3 seconds):

1. **Fisher-Yates shuffle**: Scrambles each word with zero bias
2. **Collision detection**: Ensures scrambled ≠ original (forces at least 1 letter moved)
3. **Fractional clue calculator**: Reveals floor(word_length ÷ 2) letters for Easy mode
4. **Image matcher**: Pulls weather images from 3,000+ library
5. **Layout engine**: Arranges elements in 2-column portrait layout
6. **Dual-canvas system**: Creates worksheet + answer key simultaneously

**Processing time: 1.8 seconds for 6 words**

**What you see**:
- Left column: Scrambled words with 1/2 letters revealed (colored vowels)
- Right column: Weather images
- Answer key: Complete solutions (auto-generated)

**Example**:
- "rainbow" → scrambled as "nwbario", displayed as "**r**_**i**_**b**_**w**" (half revealed)
- Rainbow image appears on right

**Time elapsed: 50 seconds total**

---

## Step 3: Edit & Export (60-90 seconds)

### Here's Where LessonCraftStudio.com Destroys Static Generators

**Typical static generator**:
- Generate → Download PDF → Hope it's perfect
- If not perfect → Regenerate and pray

**LessonCraftStudio.com**:
- Generate → **EDIT EVERYTHING** → Download when perfect

---

### What You Can Edit (Post-Generation)

#### **1. Move Elements**

**How**: Click any text/image, drag to new position

- Time: 15 seconds

---

#### **2. Resize Text**

**How**: Select text → Adjust font size slider (12-48px)

- Increase from 18px to 27px (1.5×)
- Time: 10 seconds

**IEP compliance: Completed in 10 seconds vs 30 minutes recreating in Word**

---

#### **3. Rotate Elements**

**How**: Select element → Click rotation handle, drag

**Use case**: Add visual variety for engagement
- Rotate images 5-10° (playful, non-institutional look)

---

#### **8. Adjust Layouts**

- Reduces left-right eye movement
- Time: 5 seconds (one click)

---

### The 20-State Undo/Redo System

## Is the Subscription Worth It for Editing Alone?

### ROI Calculation

**Weekly savings**: 3 worksheets × 42 min = **126 minutes = 2.1 hours**

**Annual savings** (36 weeks): **75.6 hours**

**Teacher time value** (conservative $30/hour): 75.6 hrs × $30 = **$2,268**

**Core Bundle cost**: $144/year

**Net benefit**: $2,268 - $144 = **$2,124/year**

**ROI**: 15.75× return on investment

---

### The Editing Feature Alone Justifies the Cost

**Even if you ignore**:
- Commercial license (can sell on TPT)
- Answer key automation
