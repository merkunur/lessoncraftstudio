# ============================================
# WORKSHEET GENERATORS & CONTENT MANAGERS
# ============================================
# Architecture:
# - REFERENCE folders (REFERENCE APPS, REFERENCE CONTENT MANAGERS) = SOURCE OF TRUTH in git
# - Deployed versions (frontend/public/) = NOT in git, deployed manually from REFERENCE folders
# See DEPLOYMENT.md for complete documentation

# Worksheet Generators - ALL HTML files in worksheet-generators (NOT tracked by git)
# These are deployed manually from REFERENCE APPS and REFERENCE CONTENT MANAGERS folders
frontend/public/worksheet-generators/*.html

# Translation Files - NOT tracked by git
# Deployed manually from REFERENCE TRANSLATIONS folder
frontend/public/worksheet-generators/js/translations-*.js
frontend/public/worksheet-generators/translations-*.js
frontend/public/worksheet-generators/js/translations.js

# Content Managers in public root - DEPLOYED VERSIONS (NOT tracked by git)
# These are deployed manually from REFERENCE CONTENT MANAGERS folder
frontend/public/homepage-content-manager.html

# Note: REFERENCE APPS/ and REFERENCE CONTENT MANAGERS/ folders ARE tracked by git (source of truth)

# All local working copies and variations (NOT tracked by git)
