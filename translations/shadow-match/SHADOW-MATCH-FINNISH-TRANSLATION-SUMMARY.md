## Special Note on Finnish Uniqueness

Finnish stands apart from all other European languages in this translation project. As the only Finno-Ugric language (along with Estonian and Hungarian in Europe), it requires completely different translation strategies. The lack of articles, extensive case system, vowel harmony, and agglutinative nature make this translation fundamentally different from the Germanic and Romance language versions. This uniqueness has been fully respected and leveraged to create a translation that feels completely natural to Finnish speakers.
