## Introduction: Teaching to Learn

**Research** (Chi et al., 2001): Students who teach peers learn material **50% better** than students who are taught

**Why teaching improves learning**:
```
Passive learning (being taught):
Student: Listens, takes notes, tries to remember
Retention: 20-30%

Active learning (teaching others):
Student: Must understand deeply to explain
Student: Organizes knowledge to teach
Student: Answers questions, clarifies confusion
Retention: 70-90%

Result: "To teach is to learn twice" (Japanese proverb)
```

**Peer tutoring benefits**:
- **Tutor**: Deepens understanding (explaining solidifies knowledge)
- **Tutee**: Gets personalized support (peer explains differently than teacher)
- **Teacher**: Multiplies reach (30 students → 15 pairs = 15 mini-teachers)

## Structured Peer Tutoring Model

**Not just "smart kid helps struggling kid"** (that's unequal)

**Reciprocal model**: Everyone is tutor AND tutee (equal roles)

### Monday-Wednesday-Friday Structure

**Monday**: Student A tutors Student B (math)
**Wednesday**: Student B tutors Student A (vocabulary)
**Friday**: Both work collaboratively (problem-solving)

**Example**:
```
Monday - Math Worksheet (20 addition problems):
Student A: Completed worksheet yesterday, scored 18/20 (90%)
Student B: Struggling with regrouping

Process:
1. Student A demonstrates: "Here's how I solve 47+28"
2. Student B watches, asks questions
3. Student B tries next problem with Student A coaching
4. Students alternate (Student B solves, Student A checks)
5. Both complete 10 problems with shared support

Result: Student B learns from peer explanation (often clearer than teacher)
        Student A reinforces own learning (teaching = deep processing)
```

---

## Worksheet-Based Tutoring Protocol

**Clear structure** (not just "help each other")

### 5-Step Tutoring Process

**Step 1: Model**
```
Tutor: "Watch me do the first problem"
Tutor solves: 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4
Tutor explains: "I added the top numbers (3+2=5) and kept the bottom number same (4)"

Tutee: Observes, listens (no interruptions during model)
```

**Step 2: Guided Practice**
```
Tutor: "Now you try the next one: 1/4 + 3/4"
Tutee: Works through problem, talks aloud
Tutee: "Add top: 1+3=4, keep bottom: 4, answer is 4/4"

Tutor: Checks work, provides feedback
Tutor: "Perfect! 4/4 is the same as 1 whole."
```

**Step 3: Independent Practice with Checking**
```
Tutee: Completes next 3 problems independently
Tutor: Watches, doesn't interrupt (let tutee work)
Tutor: After 3 problems, checks answers with answer key

If correct: "Great job! Ready for next 3?"
If errors: "Let's look at #7 together. What happened here?"
```

**Step 4: Switch Roles (if reciprocal model)**
```
After 10 problems: Roles reverse
Former tutee → tutor
Former tutor → tutee

Both benefit: Each gets to teach AND be taught
```

**Step 5: Reflection**
```
End of session (2 minutes):
"What did you learn from teaching/being taught today?"
"What was hard about being the tutor?"
"What was helpful about how your partner taught you?"

Metacognition: Thinking about learning process
```

## Training Student Tutors

**Can't assume students know how to tutor** (must teach explicitly)

### Week 1: Teacher Models Tutoring

**Setup**: Teacher role-plays both tutor and tutee

```
Teacher (as tutor): "I'm going to show you how to be a good tutor. Watch carefully."

Teacher models:
✓ Demonstrates problem first (modeling)
✓ Explains thinking aloud ("First I...")
✓ Asks tutee to try (guided practice)
✓ Gives specific praise ("You remembered to regroup!")
✓ Corrects gently ("Let's check that step again")

Students: Observe, take notes on "good tutor behaviors"
```

**What NOT to do** (also model):
```
Teacher (as BAD tutor):
✗ Grabs pencil, does problem for tutee ("Here, I'll just do it")
✗ Says "That's wrong" without explaining why
✗ Gets impatient, sighs
✗ Does all talking, doesn't let tutee explain thinking

Students: Identify problems with this approach
Lesson: Tutoring is teaching, not just giving answers
```

---

### Week 2: Guided Practice with Scaffolding

**Activity**: Students practice tutoring with teacher support

```
Pair students: Partner A and Partner B
Give worksheet: 10 math problems

Instructions:
"Partner A will tutor Partner B through first 5 problems using the 5-step process. I'll walk around and coach."

Teacher: Circulates, provides real-time feedback
- "Great job modeling! Now ask your partner to try one."
- "I noticed you gave the answer. Instead, ask a guiding question."
- "Nice! You let your partner struggle a bit before helping."

After 5 problems: Partners switch roles
```

---

### Week 3: Independent Peer Tutoring

**Students ready to tutor without scaffolding**:
```
Teacher assigns:
Mondays: Math tutoring pairs
Wednesdays: Vocabulary tutoring pairs
Fridays: Collaborative problem-solving

Teacher: Monitors from distance (intervenes only if needed)
Students: Self-manage tutoring process

Result: Teacher freed to work with students needing intensive support while others learn from peers
```

## Peer Tutoring Worksheets

**Specially designed for tutoring**

### Tutoring Packet Structure

**Worksheet 1: Model Problems** (3 problems with solutions shown)
```
Problem 1: 47 + 28 = 75

  47
+ 28
----
  75

Step-by-step:
1. Add ones: 7+8=15 (write 5, carry 1)
2. Add tens: 4+2=6, plus carried 1=7
3. Answer: 75

Tutor: Use this as example when teaching
```

**Worksheet 2: Guided Practice** (5 problems, tutor guides)
```
Problem 1: 52 + 39 = ____
Tutee: Works with tutor coaching

Problem 2-5: Similar difficulty
```

**Worksheet 3: Independent Practice** (10 problems, tutee alone)
```
Tutee completes independently
Tutor checks with answer key after completion
```

**Worksheet 4: Challenge** (3 harder problems, collaborative)
```
Both students work together (equal partners)
No designated tutor/tutee (true collaboration)
```

---

## Cross-Age Tutoring

**5th graders tutor 2nd graders** (both benefit)

### Implementation Protocol

**Setup**:
```
Schedule: Every Friday, 30 minutes
Pairing: One 5th grader with one 2nd grader
Location: 2nd-grade classroom (tutees' space = comfortable)
Materials: 2nd-grade level worksheets (appropriate for tutee)
```

**5th-grader training**:
```
Week before starting:
5th-grade teacher: "Next week you'll tutor 2nd graders. Let's prepare."

Training topics:
- How to explain simply (use pictures, not complex words)
- How to be patient (remember when you were in 2nd grade)
- How to encourage (praise effort, not just answers)
- What to do if confused (get 2nd-grade teacher)

Practice: 5th graders role-play tutoring each other
```

**Friday tutoring session**:
```
2:00-2:05: 5th graders arrive, greet tutees
2:05-2:20: Tutoring (worksheet practice)
2:20-2:25: Wrap-up, high-five, positive feedback
2:25-2:30: 5th graders return to class

2nd graders: Get personalized help (5th grader dedicated to them)
5th graders: Reinforce own math skills (teaching = learning)
```

**Benefits**:
- 2nd graders: Individualized support, positive role model
- 5th graders: Leadership skills, deepen understanding, empathy
- Teachers: Relationships built across grade levels, behavior improvement

## Reciprocal Teaching with Reading

**Strategy** (Palincsar & Brown, 1984): Students take turns teaching comprehension strategies

### Reciprocal Teaching Roles

**Reading passage + worksheet with 4 roles**:

**Role 1: Summarizer**
```
Task: Summarize passage in 2-3 sentences
Worksheet: "The main idea was..."
Skills: Identifying key points, concise communication
```

**Role 2: Questioner**
```
Task: Ask 3 questions about passage
Worksheet: "I wonder..."
Example: "Why did the character decide to...?"
Skills: Generating questions, critical thinking
```

**Role 3: Clarifier**
```
Task: Identify confusing parts, help explain
Worksheet: "This part was confusing: ___ I think it means..."
Skills: Monitoring comprehension, explaining
```

**Role 4: Predictor**
```
Task: Predict what happens next
Worksheet: "I think next..."
Skills: Using evidence, inferring
```

**Rotation**: Each student takes all 4 roles over 4 reading passages
Result: Everyone teaches comprehension strategies

---

## Peer Checking & Feedback

**Self-correction + peer review**

### Two-Stage Grading

**Stage 1: Self-Check**
```
Student completes: 20 math problems
Teacher provides: Answer key
Student: Marks own paper, circles errors

Benefit: Immediate feedback (see mistakes right away)
```

**Stage 2: Peer Review**
```
Student trades: Paper with partner
Partner: Checks corrections (did they fix errors correctly?)
Partner: Writes feedback: "Great work!" or "Check #7 again"

Benefit: Second set of eyes, peer accountability
```

**Teacher: Final check** (5 minutes for 30 students, just scanning for completion and patterns)

---

## Monitoring Peer Tutoring Quality

**Ensure effective tutoring** (not just social time)

### Observation Checklist

**Teacher circulates with checklist**:
```
Tutor: _________ | Tutee: _________

✓ Tutor demonstrated problem first
✓ Tutor explained thinking aloud
✓ Tutee attempted problem independently
✓ Tutor gave specific feedback
✓ Both students engaged (not off-task)

Notes: _______________________________

If needed, teacher intervenes:
"I noticed you're doing all the problems. Remember, your job is to TEACH, not do the work."
```
