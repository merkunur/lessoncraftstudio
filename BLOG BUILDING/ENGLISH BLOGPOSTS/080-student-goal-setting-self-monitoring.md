## Introduction: From Teacher-Directed to Student-Owned

**Traditional learning**: Teacher sets goals, tracks progress, decides next steps
```
Teacher: "This week we're learning multiplication"
Student: Passive recipient (does what teacher says)
Result: External motivation (working for teacher, not self)
```

**Student-owned learning**: Student sets goals, tracks progress, evaluates growth
```
Student: "My goal is to master 7s multiplication facts by Friday"
Student: Tracks daily progress (Monday: 40%, Tuesday: 55%, Wednesday: 70%)
Student: Achieves goal Friday (85% mastery)
Result: Internal motivation (working toward own goal)
```

**Research** (Hattie & Timperley, 2007): Student self-monitoring has **0.62 effect size** (equivalent to 1.5 years of additional growth)

**Key insight**: Students who track own progress outperform teacher-tracked peers

## SMART Goals for Elementary Students

**SMART framework** (Doran, 1981):
- **S**pecific: Clear, defined objective
- **M**easurable: Can track with numbers/data
- **A**chievable: Challenging but possible
- **R**elevant: Matters to student
- **T**ime-bound: Has deadline

### Age-Appropriate SMART Goals

**Grades 2-3**:
```
Vague goal: "Get better at math"
SMART goal: "I will answer 8 out of 10 addition problems correctly by Friday"

Specific: Addition problems ✓
Measurable: 8/10 (80%) ✓
Achievable: Currently at 6/10, 8/10 realistic ✓
Relevant: Student wants to improve math ✓
Time-bound: By Friday ✓
```

**Grades 4-5**:
```
Vague goal: "Improve reading"
SMART goal: "I will read 90 words per minute (WPM) with 95% accuracy by end of month"

Current: 75 WPM
Goal: 90 WPM (15 WPM increase over 4 weeks = realistic)
Measurement: Weekly fluency checks
```

## Progress Monitoring Charts

**Visual progress tracking**: Students graph own data

### Multiplication Facts Fluency Chart

**Setup**:
```
Chart on wall or in student folder:

Multiplication Facts Progress

Week 1: [Bar graph showing 40% mastery]
Week 2: [Bar graph showing 55% mastery]
Week 3: [Bar graph showing 70% mastery]
Week 4: [Bar graph showing 85% mastery] ← GOAL MET!

Student: Colors in bars each week
Visual feedback: See growth over time (intrinsic motivation)
```

**Generator application**: Weekly multiplication worksheet (20 problems)
```
Monday: Student completes worksheet
Student: Checks answers with answer key
Student: Calculates % correct (16/20 = 80%)
Student: Colors bar graph to 80%

Result: Student owns data (not waiting for teacher to grade)
```

---

### Reading Fluency Progress Line Graph

**Tracking reading speed**:
```
Line graph:
Y-axis: Words per minute (WPM)
X-axis: Weeks

Week 1: 65 WPM (plot point)
Week 2: 70 WPM (plot point, connect with line)
Week 3: 72 WPM (plot point, connect)
Week 4: 78 WPM (plot point, connect)

Goal line: 85 WPM (drawn as dotted line)
Student: Sees trajectory toward goal
```

---

## Self-Assessment Rubrics

**Student evaluates own work** (not just teacher)

### Simple Self-Assessment Checklist

**After completing math worksheet**:
```
Before turning in, check:

☐ I wrote my name and date
☐ I attempted every problem (no blanks)
☐ I showed my work
☐ I checked my answers
☐ I corrected any mistakes I found

If all checked: Turn in with confidence!
If not all checked: Fix missing items first

Self-regulation: Student takes responsibility (quality check before submission)
```

---

### Quality Self-Rating

**Student rates own effort**:
```
After completing crossword puzzle:

My effort today:
☐ Outstanding (I tried every clue, used strategies, didn't give up)
☐ Good (I tried most clues, asked for help when stuck)
☐ Acceptable (I completed the work, but could have tried harder)
☐ Needs improvement (I gave up too quickly)

What I'm proud of: ___________________________
Next time I will: ____________________________

Teacher: Reviews student self-rating, provides feedback
Metacognition: Student thinks about own work quality
```

---

## Learning Journals

**Weekly reflection writing**:

### Friday Reflection Prompts

**Rotation of prompts** (different each week):

**Week 1 prompt**: "What was the hardest thing you learned this week? How did you handle it?"

**Week 2 prompt**: "What's one thing you can do now that you couldn't do at the start of the week?"

**Week 3 prompt**: "When did you feel most proud of your learning this week?"

**Week 4 prompt**: "What goal will you set for yourself next week?"

**Student example response**:
```
Prompt: What was the hardest thing you learned this week?

Student writing:
The hardest thing was solving math puzzles with 3 unknowns. At first I didn't know where to start. But I kept trying different strategies. I used the guess-and-check method and finally solved it! I learned that if I keep trying, I can figure out hard problems. Next time I'll start with guess-and-check right away.

Metacognitive benefits:
- Identified challenge ✓
- Described strategy ✓
- Reflected on persistence ✓
- Planned for future ✓
```

## Peer Feedback & Self-Correction

**Students check own work, then peer reviews**

### Two-Stage Correction Protocol

**Stage 1: Self-Check**
```
Student completes worksheet (20 problems)
Teacher provides answer key
Student: Marks own paper (circles incorrect answers)
Student: Attempts to correct errors independently
```

**Stage 2: Peer Review**
```
Student trades with partner
Partner: Checks corrections (were errors fixed correctly?)
Partner: Provides feedback ("Great job!" or "Check #7 again")
Student: Makes final corrections
```

**Benefits**:
- Self-regulation (check own work before submitting)
- Error analysis (why was I wrong?)
- Peer learning (explain to each other)
- Teacher time saved (students do first-pass grading)

☐☐☐☐☐ (25 students mastered)
☐☐☐☐☐ (30 students mastered - GOAL MET!)

Each student: Adds sticker when they master (visual progress)
Class: Works together toward collective goal (community)
```

## Teaching the Self-Monitoring Process

**Explicit instruction needed** (don't assume students know how)

### Week 1: Introduce Goal Setting

**Teacher models**:
```
"My goal this week is to respond to all parent emails within 24 hours. I'll check my email every morning and afternoon. At the end of each day, I'll mark whether I met my goal. By Friday, I'll see if I achieved it all week."

Students: Watch teacher model (see process)
```

### Week 2: Guided Practice

**Teacher and students together**:
```
Class goal: Everyone completes homework 4/5 days
Each day: Students record (Did I complete homework? Yes/No)
Friday: Count (Did I meet 4/5 days goal?)

Teacher: Guides reflection ("If not, what got in the way?")
```

### Week 3: Independent Practice

**Students set individual goals**:
```
Student chooses own goal from options:
- Math facts fluency
- Reading speed
- Spelling accuracy
- Homework completion

Student: Tracks progress independently
Teacher: Checks in Friday (monitors but doesn't micromanage)
```

### Week 4: Full Ownership

**Students lead own goal-setting**:
```
Student: Sets goal without teacher input
Student: Decides how to track progress
Student: Reflects on achievement
Student: Sets new goal for following week

Teacher: Facilitates only (student-driven)
```
