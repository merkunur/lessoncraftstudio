## Pricing Verification Needed

**QUESTION FOR USER:**
The SEO-RULES.md states: "ONLY Word Search is FREE: Word Search generator (with watermark on worksheets), Personal use only (NO commercial use), Limited features"

However, Word Search does NOT appear in either:
- Core Bundle ($144/year) list
- Full Access ($240/year) list

**Before proceeding with content, need clarification:**
- Is Word Search truly free (with watermark)?
- Or does it require subscription?
- How should we position pricing in the Italian app page?

If it's free with limitations, the app page language will need to focus on:
- Free basic use (with watermark)
- Subscription removes watermark + adds commercial license
- Different messaging than other apps
