## Introduction: The 100th Day Milestone

**Special day**: Approximately mid-year celebration (varies by calendar)

**Why celebrate 100 days?**
```
Significance:
- Concrete milestone (young students understand "100")
- Mid-year marker (halfway through school year)
- Number sense focus (exploring quantity of 100)
- Community building (shared celebration)
- Counting achievement (we made it 100 days!)

Traditional celebration: Fun activities centered around number 100
```

**Educational value**: Not just party, learning opportunity
```
Math skills practiced:
- Counting to 100 (fundamental skill)
- Skip counting (by 2s, 5s, 10s to reach 100)
- Place value (understanding 100 as 10 tens)
- Addition (combinations that make 100)
- Estimation (what does 100 look like?)

Cross-curricular:
- Writing (100 words, list 100 things)
- Art (create with 100 objects)
- STEM (build with 100 pieces)
- Social Studies (interview 100-year-olds, history)
```

**Key principle**: Make learning fun through celebration theme

## Counting Collections: Hands-On 100

**Concrete understanding of "100"**

### Bring 100 Items from Home

**Assignment** (week before):
```
"100 Day Collection"

Directions: Collect 100 small items from home
Ideas: buttons, pennies, Cheerios, beads, paper clips, stickers

Bring on: 100th Day of School

What we'll do:
- Display your collection
- Organize in groups (by 2s, 5s, or 10s)
- Compare collections (whose is biggest/smallest?)
- Share your collection with class

Worksheet to complete at home:

My 100 Collection

I collected: 100 _______________

I counted by: ☐ 1s  ☐ 2s  ☐ 5s  ☐ 10s

It took me ____ minutes to collect them.

The hardest part was: _________________________

[Draw or glue sample of your items]

Parent signature: _______________
```

---

### Grouping and Organizing

**In-class activity** (day of):
```
Math station: "Organize Your 100"

Task: Group your 100 items different ways

Worksheet recording:

Organizing 100 Objects

My objects: _______________

Method 1: Groups of 2
I made ___ groups of 2 = 100

Method 2: Groups of 5
I made ___ groups of 5 = 100

Method 3: Groups of 10
I made ___ groups of 10 = 100

Which method was easiest? Why?
_________________________________________________

Learning: Place value (10 groups of 10 = 100), skip counting, multiplication foundations
```

## 100-Themed Math Activities

**Number sense through celebration**

### 100s Chart Puzzles

**Activity**:
```
Worksheet: 100s chart with missing numbers

[10×10 grid with numbers 1-100, many blank spaces]

Challenge levels:

Easy: 10 missing numbers
Medium: 25 missing numbers
Hard: 50 missing numbers

Students: Fill in missing numbers
Skills: Number patterns, counting, number relationships (what comes before/after?)

Extension: Color patterns (multiples of 2, 5, 10 different colors)
```

---

### Ways to Make 100

**Combination exploration**:
```
Worksheet: "100 Combinations"

Addition combinations that equal 100:
50 + 50 = 100
75 + 25 = 100
90 + 10 = 100
__ + __ = 100 (find 10 more!)

Subtraction from 100:
100 - 0 = 100
100 - 10 = 90
100 - 25 = ___
100 - ___ = ___ (create 10 more!)

Multiplication to 100:
10 × 10 = 100
20 × 5 = 100
25 × 4 = 100
__ × __ = 100 (find more factors!)

Challenge: Use three numbers
33 + 33 + 34 = 100
50 + 25 + 25 = 100

Learning: Number flexibility, operations, mental math
```
