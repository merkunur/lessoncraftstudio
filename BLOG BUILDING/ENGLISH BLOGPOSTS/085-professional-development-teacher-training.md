## Introduction: Teachers as Learners

**Effective PD characteristics** (Darling-Hammond et al., 2017):
1. Content-focused (specific instructional strategies)
2. Active learning (practice, not just lecture)
3. Collaborative (teachers learn together)
4. Sustained over time (not one-shot workshops)
5. Job-embedded (apply immediately in classroom)

**Research** (Yoon et al., 2007): PD with **30+ hours** of active learning improves student achievement **21 percentile points**

**Traditional PD problem**:
```
One-day workshop:
Morning: Presenter lectures about strategy (passive listening)
Lunch: Networking
Afternoon: More lecturing
Teachers leave: Inspired but no practical tools
Monday: Back to same teaching (nothing changes)

Result: Zero implementation (inspiration doesn't equal application)
```

**Generator-based PD solution**:
```
PD workshop (3 hours):
Hour 1: Brief intro to strategy (15 min lecture, 45 min practice)
Hour 2: Teachers create materials (generate 10 worksheets in 7 min)
Hour 3: Peer sharing + planning implementation

Monday: Teachers use generated materials immediately
Week 2: Follow-up PD (share results, troubleshoot)

Result: Immediate application (materials ready, strategy practiced)
```

## PD Workshop Model: Differentiated Instruction

**Workshop goal**: Teachers learn to create tiered worksheets

### Hour 1: Learn Strategy (60 minutes)

**15-minute mini-lecture**:
```
Facilitator explains:
- What is differentiation? (meeting students where they are)
- Why tiered worksheets? (one topic, three difficulty levels)
- How to tier: Complexity, scaffolding, problem count

Teachers: Take notes (not passive - fill in handout)
```

**45-minute hands-on practice**:
```
Facilitator: "Now YOU create tiered worksheets"

Step 1 (10 min): Access generator
- Teachers log in
- Facilitator demos: "Here's how to adjust settings"

Step 2 (15 min): Generate 3 levels
- Level 1: Struggling students (10 problems, picture mode)
- Level 2: On-level (15 problems, mixed)
- Level 3: Advanced (25 problems, complex)
- Time: 126 seconds to create all 3

Step 3 (20 min): Examine results
- Teachers review own generated worksheets
- Partner discussion: "How are these different?"
- Identify features of each level

Active learning: Teachers DO the strategy (not just hear about it)
```

---

### Hour 2: Create Materials (60 minutes)

**Independent generation time**:
```
Facilitator: "Create next week's materials for your classroom"

Teachers generate:
- Monday: 3-level math worksheet (2 min)
- Tuesday: 3-level vocabulary (2 min)
- Wednesday: 3-level reading comp (2 min)
- Thursday: 3-level science (2 min)
- Friday: Assessment (2 min)

Total: 10 minutes for entire week's differentiated materials

Remaining time (50 min):
- Organize materials (print, label, file)
- Plan implementation (which students get which level?)
- Create answer keys
```

**Teacher testimonial during workshop**:
```
"I've been wanting to differentiate but never had time to create three versions of everything. In 10 minutes I have a week's worth! This is game-changing."
```

---

### Hour 3: Collaborative Planning (60 minutes)

**Grade-level team planning**:
```
Grade 2 teachers (4 teachers):
- Share generated materials
- Discuss implementation strategies
- Plan: "Let's all try differentiation Mon-Wed, meet Thursday to discuss"
- Schedule: Follow-up PD in 2 weeks

Collaborative: Learning from peers (shared problem-solving)
```

**Commitment to action**:
```
Each teacher completes:
"This week I will implement _____________ (strategy)
In my classroom by _____________ (specific action)
I'll know it worked when _____________ (measurable outcome)"

Example:
"This week I will implement tiered math worksheets in my classroom by giving Level 1 to my 5 struggling students, Level 2 to my 18 on-level students, and Level 3 to my 7 advanced students. I'll know it worked when all students complete their worksheets successfully (80%+ accuracy)."

Accountability: Written commitment (increases follow-through)
```

---

## Follow-Up PD Session (2 Weeks Later)

**30-minute check-in**:

### Share Results

**Teachers report implementation**:
```
Teacher A: "I tried tiered worksheets. My struggling students completed 90% (usually 60%). They said it felt 'easier' - really it was just right-sized for them!"

Teacher B: "My advanced students loved Level 3. They finished and asked, 'Can I do more?' First time they've been challenged!"

Teacher C: "I struggled with which students go in which level. Some were offended by getting 'easy' work."

Facilitator: Troubleshoots Issue C
"Try letting students self-select level. Post three bins labeled 'Practice, Standard, Challenge' - no negative labels. Students choose."

Peer learning: Teachers solve each other's problems
```

---

### Adjust & Refine

**Iterative improvement**:
```
Facilitator: "Based on your experiences, what would you change?"

Teachers:
- "Add fourth 'honors' level for truly advanced"
- "Include answer keys for all levels (self-checking)"
- "Create visual cue (color-coded) so students know which level"

Action: Teachers generate improved materials (apply feedback)
Time: 15 minutes to refine
```

---

## Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)

**Ongoing collaborative learning**

### Monthly PLC Protocol

**Week 1: Generate & Share**
```
Meeting (45 min):
- Each teacher generates materials for upcoming unit
- Share with team (upload to shared drive)
- Discuss: "What skills are we targeting?"

Outcome: Team has complete unit materials (collaborative efficiency)
```

**Week 2: Implement**
```
No meeting: Teachers use materials in classrooms
Data collection: Save student work samples
```

**Week 3: Analyze Results**
```
Meeting (45 min):
- Bring: Student work samples
- Analyze: "Which worksheet was most effective? Why?"
- Data: Compare student performance across team

Facilitator: "Teacher A's students scored 85% on this worksheet. Teacher B's scored 70%. What was different?"

Discussion: Instructional strategies (not just materials)
Learning: What works, what doesn't (evidence-based)
```

**Week 4: Refine Practice**
```
Meeting (45 min):
- Based on data: What changes for next unit?
- Action planning: Specific strategies to try
- Generate: Next unit materials (apply learnings)

Cycle repeats: Continuous improvement
```

## Demonstration Lessons

**PD through modeling**

### Demonstration Lesson Structure

**Pre-Observation** (10 minutes):
```
Demonstrating teacher: Explains lesson plan to observers
"Today I'm teaching fractions using tiered worksheets. Watch how I:
1. Introduce concept to whole class
2. Distribute differentiated worksheets
3. Monitor each group
4. Adjust support based on needs"

Observers: Receive observation focus (what to look for)
```

**Lesson Observation** (30 minutes):
```
Demonstrating teacher: Teaches while colleagues observe

Observers note:
- How does teacher introduce strategy?
- How do students respond to differentiated materials?
- What challenges arise?
- What management strategies are effective?
```

**Post-Observation Debrief** (20 minutes):
```
Reflecting questions:
- "What did you notice about student engagement?"
- "How did differentiation impact learning?"
- "What would you try in your classroom?"
- "What questions do you have?"

Demonstrating teacher: Shares reasoning behind decisions
Observers: Internalize strategy (saw it in action)
```

## Peer Coaching Pairs

**Job-embedded support**

### Coaching Cycle

**Week 1: Co-Planning**
```
Coach and teacher meet (30 min):
- Identify: Focus skill (e.g., differentiation)
- Generate: Materials together (worksheets for week)
- Plan: How will differentiation look in classroom?
```

**Week 2: Observation**
```
Coach: Observes teacher implementing strategy (20 min)
Takes notes: Specific evidence of strategy use
```

**Week 3: Feedback Meeting**
```
Coach and teacher meet (30 min):
- Coach: "I noticed you gave three levels. Students seemed engaged."
- Teacher: "I'm struggling with time - takes too long to pass out three versions"
- Coach: "Try color-coding. Blue bin for Level 1, red for Level 2, green for Level 3. Students grab their color."
- Teacher: "That would save 5 minutes!"

Action plan: Teacher tries coach's suggestion next week
```

**Week 4: Follow-Up**
```
Coach: Observes again (check implementation of suggestion)
Coach: "Color-coding worked! Distribution took 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes."

Cycle: Repeats with new focus skill
```

## Administrator PD: Supporting Teachers

**PD for principals**

### Admin Workshop: Recognizing Effective Differentiation

**Goal**: Admins learn what to look for during walkthroughs

**Training content**:
```
What to observe:
✓ Multiple worksheet versions visible (differentiation happening)
✓ Students engaged at appropriate level (not too easy/hard)
✓ Teacher circulating strategically (giving targeted support)
✓ Materials organized/accessible (systems in place)

What to ask teachers:
"How did you decide which students get which level?"
"What data informed your differentiation?"
"How do you track student progress across levels?"

Feedback: Specific, actionable (not vague praise)
```
