        title: 'Choose Your Content',
        description: 'Start by selecting six images for your treasure hunt grid using one of two methods. The fastest approach uses theme-based automatic generation where you select a category like "Farm Animals" or "School Supplies" and the generator automatically chooses six related images. This works perfectly when creating general kindergarten worksheets or first grade worksheets that don\'t require specific vocabulary. The manual selection method gives you precise control over which images appear in your worksheet. Browse the 3000+ image library using theme filters or the search function. Click six individual images to build custom vocabulary sets. Teachers use manual selection when creating targeted phonics worksheets, sight words worksheets, or math worksheets that must feature specific objects for curriculum alignment. Upload your own images for maximum personalization. Combine uploaded photos with library images to create treasure hunt worksheets that connect directly to your classroom lessons. This flexibility helps special education teachers create highly individualized free printable worksheets featuring familiar objects from students\' daily experiences.',

        description: 'Choose your page size from Letter Portrait, Letter Landscape, A4 Portrait, A4 Landscape, or Square formats. Portrait orientation works best for vertical filing systems and standard worksheet binders. Landscape orientation provides more horizontal space for longer instruction clues. Select the format that matches your classroom organization system and printing setup. Set the direction vocabulary type based on your students\' grade level and curriculum standards. Choose basic directions with up/down/left/right terminology for preschool through first grade students. This age-appropriate vocabulary appears in most kindergarten worksheets and early first grade worksheets. Switch to cardinal directions using north/south/east/west for second grade and above when students learn map skills and geographic orientation. Add optional background themes or border decorations to create visually engaging free printable worksheets. The opacity slider lets you adjust background intensity so decorative elements enhance without overwhelming the instructional content.',

        description: 'Click the generate button and watch your treasure hunt worksheet appear instantly on the canvas. The automatic layout system positions the 5x5 image grid and instruction clues in an optimized arrangement for readability. Landscape pages show clues on the left with the grid on the right. Portrait pages stack clues above the grid. Both layouts maximize space efficiency for clear, uncluttered worksheets. The generation algorithm creates six random directional moves that guide students from the starting image to the treasure location. No two worksheets are identical because the moves randomize with each generation. Teachers create multiple differentiated first grade worksheets for different ability groups by generating several variations using the same image set with different movement patterns. Review the preview to verify the worksheet meets your needs before downloading. Check that the instruction clues are clearly readable and the grid images are large enough for young students to identify easily.',

Insert your name, classroom number, or student name fields at the top of kindergarten worksheets. Add completion instructions like "Circle the treasure when you find it" or "Color the path you followed." Include vocabulary hints or picture labels to scaffold learning for struggling readers. The unlimited text additions let you differentiate worksheets for diverse learners. Teachers combine treasure hunt worksheets with other worksheet types by adding elements from different generators.

The answer key shows the identical worksheet with a red circle marking the treasure location. Having both files ready saves time during lesson prep. Print the worksheet for students and keep the answer key in your teaching materials for quick reference during instruction or assessment. Enable the grayscale toggle if you\'re printing on a black-and-white printer or want to reduce color ink consumption. Grayscale conversion maintains excellent clarity while significantly lowering printing costs.

          question: 'How does the 5x5 grid work?',
          answer: 'The grid contains 25 cells populated with 6 randomly selected images from your chosen themes. Each image appears multiple times across the grid. Students start at a designated cell and follow directional clues to move through the grid to find the final destination.',

        {
          id: '3',
          question: 'What direction modes are available?',
          answer: 'Two direction modes are available: basic directions (up, down, left, right) and cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). Basic mode suits younger learners, while cardinal mode introduces geographic vocabulary for more advanced students.',
        },
        {
          id: '4',
          question: 'How many directional steps does each hunt include?',

          id: '5',
          question: 'Can I choose which images appear in the grid?',

          question: 'What age group are treasure hunt worksheets designed for?',

          question: 'What skills do treasure hunt worksheets develop?',

        {
          id: '8',
          question: 'How do treasure hunts improve reading comprehension?',
          answer: 'Students must carefully read each directional clue, extract the direction and distance, and translate text into physical movement on the grid. This active reading requires comprehension for a concrete purpose rather than passive text consumption.',

        {
          id: '11',
          question: 'How do I adjust difficulty for different students?',
          answer: 'Use basic directions (up/down/left/right) for younger students and cardinal directions (north/south/east/west) for advanced learners. You can also vary the images: highly distinct images make tracking easier, while similar-looking images increase the challenge.',
        },

          id: '12',
          question: 'Can students use their finger to trace the path?',
          answer: 'Yes. Many teachers encourage students to place their finger on the starting cell and physically move it as they read each clue. This kinesthetic approach helps younger children track their position without losing their place in the grid.',
