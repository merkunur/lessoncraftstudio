## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Docker containers are running:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Admin user must be logged in with `isAdmin: true`

### Test 1: Subscription Overview Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/admin/subscriptions`
2. Verify dashboard displays:
   - MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) with growth percentage
   - Active subscription count
   - Average revenue per user
   - Churn rate indicator

3. Check recent activity cards:
   - New subscriptions count
   - Cancellations count
   - Upgrades count
   - Downgrades count

### Test 2: Subscription Filtering and Sorting
1. Test status filter:
   - Select "Active" - only active subscriptions shown
   - Select "Trial" - only trial subscriptions shown
   - Select "Cancelled" - only cancelled subscriptions shown

2. Test plan filter:
   - Select "Core ($9.99)" - only Core plan subscriptions
   - Select "Full ($19.99)" - only Full plan subscriptions

3. Test sorting:
   - "Newest First" - sorts by creation date descending
   - "Oldest First" - sorts by creation date ascending
   - "Highest Value" - sorts by amount descending
   - "Ending Soon" - sorts by next billing date

### Test 3: Subscription Actions
1. Find an active subscription in the list
2. Click "View" to see subscription details
3. Test "Cancel" button:
   - Confirm cancellation dialog appears
   - After confirmation, status changes to "Cancelling"
   - Subscription marked as `cancelAtPeriodEnd: true`

4. Test "Reactivate" on cancelled subscription:
   - Click "Reactivate" button
   - Status returns to "Active"
   - `cancelAtPeriodEnd` set to false

### Test 4: Date Range Selection
1. Change date range dropdown:
   - "Last 7 days" - updates stats for past week
   - "Last 30 days" - updates stats for past month
   - "Last 90 days" - updates stats for past quarter
   - "Last year" - updates stats for past year

2. Verify stats update accordingly:
   - MRR calculation changes
   - Growth rate adjusts
   - Recent activity numbers update

### Test 5: Export Functionality
1. Click "Export" button
2. CSV file should download with:
   - All current filtered subscriptions
   - Headers: Customer, Plan, Status, Amount, etc.
   - Proper date formatting

### Test 6: Payment History Page
1. Navigate to `/admin/subscriptions/payments`
2. Verify payment stats display:
   - Total Revenue
   - Successful payment count
   - Failed payment count
   - Refunded amount
   - Average payment amount

### Test 7: Payment Search and Filters
1. Search functionality:
   - Type customer email in search
   - Results filter in real-time
   - Search by payment ID (partial match)

2. Status filter:
   - "Successful" - only succeeded payments
   - "Pending" - only pending payments
   - "Failed" - only failed payments
   - "Refunded" - only refunded payments

### Test 8: Refund Process
1. Find a successful payment without refund
2. Click "Refund" button
3. Confirm refund dialog
4. Verify:
   - Payment status changes to "Refunded"
   - Refunded amount displayed
   - Stats update to reflect refund

### Test 9: Performance Benchmarks
- Dashboard initial load: < 2 seconds
- Filter/sort application: < 500ms
- Export generation: < 3 seconds for 1000 records
- Real-time search: < 200ms response time

### Test 10: Pagination
1. With more than 20 subscriptions:
   - Verify pagination controls appear
   - Navigate between pages
   - Page state persists with filters

2. Verify page info displays:
   - "Page 1 of X"
   - Previous/Next buttons work correctly
   - Disabled state on first/last page

## Visual Tests

- Stats cards in 4-column grid
- Recent activity cards in 4-column grid
- Full table width with all columns visible

### Tablet View (768px)
- Stats cards in 2-column grid
- Table scrolls horizontally if needed
- Filters stack appropriately

### Mobile View (375px)

- Simplified table view
- Filters in dropdown menu

## API Response Formats

### Subscription List Response
```json
{
  "subscriptions": [
    {
      "id": "sub_123",
      "userId": "user_456",
      "user": {
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe"
      },
      "status": "active",
      "planName": "core",
      "amount": 999,
      "interval": "month",
      "currentPeriodEnd": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z",
      "cancelAtPeriodEnd": false,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "totalCount": 98
  }
}
```

### Subscription Stats Response
```json

  "overview": {
    "totalActive": 234,
    "totalTrialing": 12,
    "totalCancelled": 45,
    "totalPaused": 3,
    "mrr": 567800,
    "arr": 6813600,
    "averageRevenue": 2426,
    "churnRate": 3.2,

    "core": {
      "count": 150,
      "mrr": 149850
    },
    "full": {
      "count": 84,
      "mrr": 167916
    }
  },
  "recent": {
    "newSubscriptions": 23,
    "cancellations": 5,
    "upgrades": 8,
    "downgrades": 2
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Authentication**
   - All endpoints require admin privileges
   - JWT token validation on every request
   - Session timeout after inactivity

2. **Sensitive Data Protection**
   - Payment methods masked in UI
   - No full card numbers displayed
   - Audit logs for all financial actions

3. **Refund Authorization**
   - Confirmation required for refunds
   - Refund limits based on admin role
   - Full audit trail of refund actions

## Accessibility Tests

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab through all interactive elements
   - Enter/Space activate buttons
   - Arrow keys navigate dropdowns

2. **Screen Reader**
   - Proper ARIA labels on buttons
   - Table headers announced correctly
   - Status changes announced

3. **Color Contrast**
   - All text meets WCAG AA standards
   - Status indicators have text labels
   - Not reliant on color alone

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Stats not updating after action
- Check API response for errors
- Verify cache invalidation
- Ensure real-time updates enabled

### Issue: Export fails with large dataset
- Check server timeout settings
- Implement pagination for export
- Consider background job for large exports

### Issue: Refund button not working
- Verify Stripe API keys configured
- Check payment status is "succeeded"
- Ensure not already refunded

### Issue: Pagination not working
- Check totalCount calculation
- Verify skip/take logic in API
- Ensure page state management

## Success Criteria
✅ Subscription dashboard displays accurate MRR
✅ Filters and sorting work correctly
✅ Cancel/reactivate subscriptions functional
✅ Payment history searchable and filterable
✅ Refund process works with confirmation
✅ Export generates valid CSV files
✅ Pagination handles large datasets
✅ Real-time stats updates
✅ Mobile responsive design
✅ All security measures in place
