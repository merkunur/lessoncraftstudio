# Homepage Content Manager 404 Error - SOLUTION ‚úÖ

## üîç Problem
The homepage content manager shows "Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)" when trying to load existing content.

## ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The API endpoint **IS working correctly**. Server logs show:
```
GET /api/homepage/content?raw=true 200 in 36ms ‚úÖ
```

The issue is one of the following:

### Issue 1: Wrong Server Port
- Multiple dev servers are running simultaneously on different ports
- The **active server is on PORT 3005**
- If you access the content manager on a different port, it will fail

### Issue 2: Multiple Content Manager Versions
There are 4 different content manager files:
- `homepage-content-manager.html` (oldest)
- `homepage-content-manager-v2.html`
- `homepage-content-manager-v3.html`
- `homepage-content-manager-v3-fixed.html` ‚úÖ **(USE THIS ONE)**

### Issue 3: Browser Cache
The browser may be caching an old version of the HTML file.

## üéØ SOLUTION - Follow These Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Correct Port

Run this command to see which port the active Next.js server is using:

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr "LISTENING" | findstr "300"
```

Look for the **highest port number** (likely 3005).

Or check the terminal where you ran `npm run dev`. It should show:
```
- Local:        http://localhost:3005
```

### Step 2: Access the Correct URL

Use this exact URL (replace 3005 with your actual port):

```
http://localhost:3005/homepage-content-manager-v3-fixed.html
```

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you use:
- The **correct port** (3005 or whatever port npm run dev shows)
- The **v3-fixed** version of the file

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache

Before opening the content manager:

1. **Hard Refresh** (to bypass cache):
   - **Chrome/Edge**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl + F5`

2. **Or Clear Cache Completely**:
   - Chrome: Press `F12` ‚Üí Right-click on reload button ‚Üí "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
   - Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` ‚Üí Clear cache

### Step 4: Verify API is Working

Open browser DevTools (F12) and go to Network tab, then:

1. Visit: `http://localhost:3005/api/homepage/content?raw=true`
2. You should see JSON data with `hero`, `samplesSection`, etc.
3. Status should be **200 OK**

If you see 404, the server port is wrong.

### Step 5: Open Content Manager

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3005/homepage-content-manager-v3-fixed.html`
2. Open browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
3. Look for these messages:
   ```
   === Homepage Content Loaded ===
   Has hero? YES
   Has samplesSection? YES
   Hero title.en: Create Professional Worksheets in Minutes
   ```

If you see these messages, the content manager is working correctly!

## üîß Additional Troubleshooting

### If You Still Get 404

**Check Server Logs**

In the terminal where `npm run dev` is running, you should see:
```
GET /api/homepage/content?raw=true 200 in XXms
```

If you see this, the API is working and the issue is with the URL you're using.

**Kill Old Servers**

Multiple dev servers might be running. Kill them all and start fresh:

1. Press `Ctrl + C` in all terminal windows running `npm run dev`
2. Kill any remaining Node processes:
   ```bash
   taskkill /F /IM node.exe
   ```
3. Restart the server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Note the port number shown (e.g., `http://localhost:3005`)
5. Use that port to access the content manager

## üìã Quick Checklist

Before reporting the issue:

- [ ] I'm using the correct port (shown in terminal after `npm run dev`)
- [ ] I'm accessing `homepage-content-manager-v3-fixed.html` (not an older version)
- [ ] I cleared browser cache with Ctrl + Shift + R
- [ ] I verified `/api/homepage/content?raw=true` returns 200 OK (not 404)
- [ ] I checked browser console for errors

## ‚úÖ Expected Working State

### Terminal Output
```
- Local:        http://localhost:3005
GET /api/homepage/content?raw=true 200 in 36ms
```

### Browser Console Output
```
=== Homepage Content Loaded ===
Has hero? YES
Has samplesSection? YES
Hero title.en: Create Professional Worksheets in Minutes
renderHeroSection called
Setting en values: {title: "Create Professional Worksheets...", titleElExists: true}
renderHeroSection completed
```

### Content Manager Display
- All form fields filled with existing content
- Hero section shows titles in all 11 languages
- Samples section shows all 33 worksheets
- No 404 errors in browser console

## üö® If Nothing Works

If you've tried all the above and still get 404:

1. **Restart Everything**:
   ```bash
   # Kill all Node processes
   taskkill /F /IM node.exe

   # Restart development server
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check API Route File Exists**:
   ```bash
   dir frontend\app\api\homepage\content\route.ts
   ```
   Should show the file exists.

3. **Test Direct API Access**:
   Open browser and visit: `http://localhost:PORT/api/homepage/content?raw=true`

   Replace PORT with the number shown after `npm run dev`.

   You should see JSON data, not a 404 page.

4. **Check for TypeScript Errors**:
   Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running.
   If there are compilation errors, the API route won't work.

## üìù Current Server Status

Based on analysis:

- ‚úÖ API endpoint EXISTS: `frontend/app/api/homepage/content/route.ts`
- ‚úÖ API is WORKING (server logs show 200 responses)
- ‚úÖ Content manager HTML has correct code (uses `/api/homepage/content?raw=true`)
- ‚úÖ Middleware is NOT blocking the API (api routes are excluded)
- ‚úÖ Database has content (previous tests showed data exists)

**Conclusion**: The issue is **environmental** (wrong port, cached file, or wrong URL), NOT a code issue.

## üéØ Recommended Action

1. Close all browser tabs with the content manager
2. Run: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` to kill all Node processes
3. Run: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
4. Note the port number (probably 3000, 3001, or 3005)
5. Wait for "Ready in XXXms" message
6. Open fresh browser window (Ctrl + Shift + N for incognito)
7. Visit: `http://localhost:PORT/homepage-content-manager-v3-fixed.html`
8. Open DevTools Console (F12) and verify you see "=== Homepage Content Loaded ==="

This should fix the 404 error.
