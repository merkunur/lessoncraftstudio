## Introduction: Academic + Social-Emotional Integration

**CASEL Framework** (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning):
5 core competencies:
1. Self-awareness
2. Self-management
3. Social awareness
4. Relationship skills
5. Responsible decision-making

**Research** (Durlak et al., 2011 - meta-analysis): SEL programs improve academic performance **11 percentile points** while also improving behavior and emotional well-being

**Why SEL matters for academic success**:
```
Student with poor self-regulation:
- Gets frustrated with difficult worksheet → gives up → doesn't learn

Student with strong self-regulation:
- Gets frustrated → takes deep breath → tries different strategy → learns

Result: SEL skills enable academic learning (can't learn when emotionally dysregulated)
```

**Key principle**: Can't separate academic and emotional (whole child learning)

## Mindfulness & Calming Activities

**Goal**: Help students self-regulate before academic work

### Transition Activity: Coloring for Calm

**Use case**: After recess (students energized, need to settle)

**Activity**:
```
Teacher: "Before we start math, take 5 minutes to color this mandala"
Materials: Coloring page (generated in 42 sec)
Music: Quiet instrumental background
Rules: Silent coloring (no talking)

Student experience:
Minute 1-2: Still wiggly, chatty (transitioning)
Minute 3-4: Settling, focused on coloring
Minute 5: Calm, ready to learn

Teacher: "Now we're ready for math. Minds are calm and focused."
```

**Generator benefit**: New coloring pages daily (variety prevents boredom)

---

### Mindful Maze Activity

**Worksheet**: Drawing Lines generator (mazes)

**Activity** (modified for mindfulness):
```
Instructions: "Complete this maze slowly. Focus only on the line you're drawing. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the line."

Mindfulness skills:
- Present-moment awareness (focusing on current line)
- Noticing when mind wanders (metacognition)
- Non-judgment (it's okay if mind wanders, just return)

Duration: 5-10 minutes (calming, centering)
Result: Regulated nervous system (ready for learning)
```

## Emotion Recognition & Vocabulary

**SEL Competency**: Self-awareness (identifying emotions)

### Feelings Word Search

**Activity**:

happy, sad, angry, frustrated, excited, nervous, proud, disappointed, grateful, confused, calm, worried

After finding words:

Emotional vocabulary: Name it to tame it (labeling emotions reduces intensity)
```
