## Introduction: Supporting Language Acquisition

**ELL student challenge**: Learn content AND language simultaneously

**Traditional worksheet challenge**:
```
Math word problem (text-heavy):
"Sarah has 24 cookies. She wants to share them equally among 6 friends. How many cookies will each friend receive?"

ELL barriers:
- Vocabulary: "share," "equally," "among," "receive" (unfamiliar words)
- Syntax: Complex sentence structure (hard to parse)
- Cultural context: Cookie-sharing scenario (may be unfamiliar)
- Result: Student can't access math (blocked by language, not math ability)
```

**Scaffolded alternative**:
```
Same problem with visual support:

[Picture: 24 cookie images]
Sarah has 24 cookies.

[Picture: 6 stick figures]
She gives cookies to 6 friends.

[Picture: Empty boxes under each friend]
Each friend gets ____ cookies.

24 ÷ 6 = ____

ELL access: Picture conveys meaning (reduced language barrier)
Result: Student CAN access math (visuals bridge language gap)
```

**Research** (Marzano, 2004): Visual representation increases comprehension **27-34%** for ELL students

**Key principle**: Show, don't just tell (visuals are universal language)

---

## Picture-Supported Worksheets

**Reduce language load with strategic images**

### Math Word Problems with Visuals

**Example**: Subtraction story problem

**Text-only version** (high language demand):
```
"The farmer had 15 apples. He sold 8 apples at the market. How many apples does he have remaining?"

Vocabulary load: farmer, sold, market, remaining (4 potentially unfamiliar words)
```

**Picture-supported version** (lower language demand):
```
[Picture: Farmer with 15 apple icons]
Start: 15 apples

[Picture: 8 apples crossed out]
Sold: 8 apples

[Picture: Empty box]
Left: ____ apples

15 - 8 = ____

Vocabulary simplified: "Start," "Sold," "Left" (basic words)
Picture support: Visual shows action (comprehension aid)
```

---

### Science Vocabulary with Images

**Topic**: Plant parts

**Text-only worksheet** (challenging for ELL):
```
Match the word to its definition:
Roots: The part of the plant that absorbs water and nutrients from soil
Stem: The part that transports water and provides support
Leaves: The part where photosynthesis occurs
Flower: The reproductive part that produces seeds
```

**Picture-supported alternative**:
```
[Large labeled plant diagram with clear images of each part]

Match the word to the picture:
☐ Roots [Picture: underground roots]
☐ Stem [Picture: tall green stem]
☐ Leaves [Picture: green leaves]
☐ Flower [Picture: colorful flower]

Function (simplified language):
Roots: Get water from dirt
Stem: Holds up plant
Leaves: Make food for plant
Flower: Makes seeds

Visual learning: ELL sees concept (picture + simple words = understanding)
```

---

## Vocabulary Scaffolding

**Build language systematically**

### Word Banks with Pictures

**Worksheet design**:
```
Topic: Weather

Word Bank (with tiny icons next to each):
☀️ sunny    ☁️ cloudy    🌧️ rainy    ❄️ snowy    💨 windy

Sentences (fill in blank with word from bank):
1. Today is ________. [Picture: Sun shining]
2. Yesterday was ________. [Picture: Rain falling]
3. Tomorrow will be ________. [Picture: Clouds]

Support: Picture cues + word bank (scaffold for success)
No support: Expecting ELL to generate weather vocabulary independently (too hard)
```

---

### Tiered Vocabulary Instruction

**Three-level approach**:

**Tier 1: Basic conversational words** (most important for ELL):
```
Worksheet focus: High-frequency words
Examples: "big," "small," "hot," "cold," "happy," "sad"

Activity: Picture matching
[Picture of elephant] ← big
[Picture of mouse] ← small

Benefit: Builds foundational vocabulary (essential for daily communication)
```

**Tier 2: Academic vocabulary** (cross-curricular):
```
Words: "compare," "describe," "explain," "analyze"

Worksheet: Sentence frames
- I can compare ____ and ____ (visual: Venn diagram)
- I can describe ____ (visual: adjective web)
- I can explain ____ (visual: cause-effect arrows)

Benefit: Academic language needed across subjects (transfer to multiple contexts)
```

**Tier 3: Content-specific terms** (domain vocabulary):
```
Science words: "photosynthesis," "metamorphosis," "evaporation"

Worksheet: Visual definitions
Photosynthesis [Picture: Plant + sun + arrow to oxygen]
= Plant uses sun to make food

Benefit: Content vocabulary with visual support (access to grade-level concepts)
```

---

## Sentence Frames and Starters

**Provide language structure**

### Math Sentence Frames

**Without frame** (challenging):
```
Question: "Explain how you solved 24 ÷ 6"
ELL response: Struggles to form coherent explanation (language barrier)
```

**With frame** (accessible):
```
Question: "Explain how you solved 24 ÷ 6"

Sentence frames provided:
First, I __________.
Then, I __________.
The answer is ____ because __________.

ELL response: Uses frame to organize thinking
"First, I drew 24 circles. Then, I divided them into 6 groups. The answer is 4 because each group has 4 circles."

Benefit: Frame provides language structure (ELL focuses on content, not grammar)
```

---

### Science Sentence Starters

**Observation worksheet**:
```
Experiment: Observing ice melting

Sentence starters:
I see...
I notice...
I predict...
I wonder...

Student responses:
"I see the ice getting smaller."
"I notice water forming."
"I predict the ice will disappear."
"I wonder where the water comes from."

Support: Starter gives first word (reduces language load), student completes thought
```

---

## Graphic Organizers

**Visual thinking frameworks**

### Venn Diagram (Compare/Contrast)

**ELL-friendly format**:
```
Topic: Comparing frogs and toads

[Visual Venn diagram with pictures]

FROGS                  BOTH               TOADS
[Frog picture]      [Shared box]      [Toad picture]

Word bank: smooth skin, bumpy skin, water, land, hop, lay eggs

Student: Drags words to correct section (or draws pictures + labels)

Benefit:
- Visual structure (shows relationships spatially)
- Word bank (no need to generate vocabulary independently)
- Pictures (reinforce categories)
```

---

### Sequence Chart

**Story retelling** (beginning ELL):
```
[Four boxes numbered 1-4, each with space for picture + sentence]

Story: "The Very Hungry Caterpillar"

Box 1: [Student draws caterpillar] "First, there was a caterpillar."
Box 2: [Student draws caterpillar eating] "Then, he ate food."
Box 3: [Student draws cocoon] "Next, he made a cocoon."
Box 4: [Student draws butterfly] "Finally, he became a butterfly."

Scaffold:
- Sentence starters (First, Then, Next, Finally)
- Drawing + writing (dual coding)
- Simple past tense (language structure model)
```

---

## Modified Worksheets for Language Levels

**Differentiate by ELL proficiency**

### Same Content, Three Levels

**Topic**: Addition word problems

**Beginning ELL** (emerging English):
```
[Picture: 3 red apples + 2 green apples]

3 + 2 = ____

Language demand: Minimal (numbers + operation)
Support: Visual shows entire problem
```

**Intermediate ELL** (developing English):
```
[Picture: Red and green apples]

Sarah has 3 red apples.
She has 2 green apples.
How many apples in all?

3 + 2 = ____

Language demand: Simple sentences (present tense, basic vocabulary)
Support: Picture + clear question
```

**Advanced ELL** (expanding/bridging English):
```
Sarah went to the orchard. She picked 3 red apples in the morning and 2 green apples in the afternoon. How many apples did she pick altogether?

3 + 2 = ____

Language demand: Complex sentences (past tense, multiple clauses)
Support: Approaching grade-level language
```

**Same math content, differentiated language complexity**

---

## Color-Coding for Clarity

**Visual organization aids comprehension**

### Parts of Speech Color System

**Grammar worksheet**:
```
Color code:
- Nouns = BLUE
- Verbs = RED
- Adjectives = GREEN

Sentence: "The big dog ran quickly."

Student colors:
- The (blue) big (green) dog (blue) ran (red) quickly (red - adverb, but simplified for early ELL)

Benefit: Visual system (easier than abstract grammar rules for language learners)
```

---

### Math Operation Colors

**Multi-operation worksheet**:
```
Color code:
- Addition problems: GREEN box
- Subtraction problems: RED box
- Multiplication problems: BLUE box
- Division problems: YELLOW box

Student sees: "Oh, GREEN box means addition!" (visual cue reduces language processing)
```

---

## Total Physical Response (TPR) Worksheets

**Connect movement to vocabulary**

### Action Verb Worksheet

**Learning activity**:
```
Vocabulary: jump, run, walk, hop, skip, crawl

Worksheet:
1. Teacher says "jump" → Students jump → Draw yourself jumping
2. Teacher says "crawl" → Students crawl → Draw yourself crawling
...

Worksheet: 6 boxes with action verbs
[Box 1: "jump" - student draws stick figure jumping]
[Box 2: "crawl" - student draws stick figure crawling]

Benefit: Body movement (kinesthetic learning) reinforces vocabulary (language + action = memory)
```

---

## Cognates for Spanish Speakers

**Leverage first language knowledge**

### Cognate Recognition Worksheet

**Science vocabulary**:
```
English Word | Spanish Cognate | Meaning
Animal       | Animal          | Living creature
Plant        | Planta          | Living thing that grows
Observe      | Observar        | To watch carefully

Activity: Circle the cognates (words that look/sound similar)

Benefit: Spanish-speaking ELLs recognize connection (build on existing knowledge, not starting from zero)
```

---

## Simplified Directions

**Clear, concise instructions**

### Before and After

**Complex directions** (confusing):
```
"Using the following word bank, fill in the blanks in the sentences below, ensuring that the correct vocabulary word is placed in each blank based on context clues from the sentence."

Language load: 28 words, complex syntax
```

**Simplified directions** (clear):
```
"Use the word bank. Fill in the blanks."

[Word Bank: cat, dog, fish, bird]

1. The ____ swims. (fish)
2. The ____ flies. (bird)

Language load: 7 words, simple syntax
Benefit: ELL understands task immediately (can focus on content, not decoding directions)
```

---

## Bilingual Worksheets (When Appropriate)

**Strategic use of home language**

### Dual-Language Math

**Example** (for Spanish-speaking ELL):
```
Addition / Suma

3 + 4 = ____

Word problem / Problema:
María tiene 3 manzanas. / Maria has 3 apples.
Juan tiene 4 manzanas. / Juan has 4 apples.
¿Cuántas manzanas en total? / How many apples total?

Benefit:
- Comprehension in L1 (ensures understanding)
- English exposure (language development)
- Content access (doesn't wait until English proficient to learn math)
```

---

## Assessment Accommodations

**Fair testing for ELL students**

### Modified Test Format

**Standard test** (high language barrier):
```
Multiple choice with wordy options:
"Which of the following statements accurately describes the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy?"
a) Plants use chlorophyll to absorb solar radiation...
b) Plants undergo a chemical reaction known as...

Language barrier: ELL can't demonstrate science knowledge due to complex English
```

**Accommodated version**:
```
Simplified question:
"How do plants make food?"

[Picture: Sun + plant + arrow]

Fill in: Plants use ____ to make food.
Word bank: sunlight, water, dirt

Language load: Reduced (tests science, not English proficiency)
Assessment: More accurate measure of content knowledge
```
