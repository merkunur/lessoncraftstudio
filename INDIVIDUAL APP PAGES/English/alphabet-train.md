Check the name and date box to add student fields. These lines appear at the top of every worksheet. Students write their information before starting the activity. This simple addition saves you from hand-drawing lines on printed copies.

Now customize your creation with full canvas editing. Click any element to select it. Drag objects to reposition them anywhere on the page. Use corner handles to resize images larger or smaller. Rotation handles let you angle elements for visual variety.

Add text elements for titles and instructions. Type your worksheet name in the text box. Click add text to place it on the canvas. Select the text to change fonts, colors, and sizes. Position your title at the top center for a professional look. Add extra instructions or encouragement messages anywhere you want.

### Step 5: Download Free Printable Worksheets as PDF - Coloring Worksheets and Math Worksheets Quality

Generate the answer key before downloading. Click the answer key button in the generate menu. This creates a second page showing all letters filled in. Switch between tabs to view each version. Make final edits to either canvas as needed.

Open the download dropdown to see all options. Choose worksheet JPEG or PDF for the main activity page. Select answer key JPEG or PDF for the solution page. PDF format preserves perfect quality for printing. JPEG works great for digital distribution and email attachments.
