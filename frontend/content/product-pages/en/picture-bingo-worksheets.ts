        question: 'How Do the Bingo Cards and Call-Out Sheets Work Together?',
        answer: 'Our picture bingo generator creates two separate worksheets that work together during gameplay. The main bingo card worksheet includes your grid with images or words in cells plus matching circular calling chips arranged below the grid on the same page. Students receive this printable worksheet. They can cut out the chips or use separate manipulatives to mark called items on their grid. The call-out sheet is a separate worksheet showing all items in an organized grid for the teacher to use when calling items during the bingo game. Both worksheets are fully editable on separate tabs in the generator. Switch between Cards plus Chips tab and Call-outs tab to customize each worksheet independently. Download each worksheet separately as JPEG or PDF files. When generating multiple cards, each student gets a unique bingo card while the teacher uses one call-out sheet that includes all possible items across all cards. This dual-output system saves teachers from manually creating matching materials. Everything you need for complete bingo gameplay generates automatically in under 3 minutes.',
