        answer: 'The picture bingo generator creates customized bingo cards with images or words in grid cells plus a separate sheet of circular calling chips. Select a theme and grid size, and the generator arranges images randomly on each card. Each generated card has a unique image arrangement so multiple students can play simultaneously with different cards. The calling chips match the card images for the teacher to use during gameplay.',

        id: '2',
        question: 'What Grid Sizes Are Available for Bingo Cards?',
        answer: 'Bingo cards support grid sizes from 3x3 to 5x5. A 3x3 grid with 9 cells works best for preschool and early kindergarten with fewer images to track. A 4x4 grid suits standard kindergarten gameplay. A 5x5 grid provides the traditional bingo experience for first and second graders. Larger grids create longer, more challenging games requiring sustained attention and faster image recognition.',

        answer: 'Yes, generate 1 to 10 unique bingo cards in a single creation session. Each card arranges the same theme images in a different random order, ensuring every student has a distinct card during classroom bingo games.

        answer: 'Choose between images or words for bingo card cells. Image mode fills cells with themed pictures for pre-readers and kindergarteners.

You can also set calling chips independently: image chips with word cards create a word-recognition game, while word chips with image cards create a vocabulary matching challenge. Mix formats for versatile learning activities.',
      },
      {
        id: '5',
        question: 'How Do the Calling Chips Work?',
        answer: 'Circular calling chips print on the same page or a separate sheet. Cut out individual chips for the teacher or caller to draw during the game. Each chip shows either an image or word matching the bingo card content. The teacher draws a chip, announces or shows it, and students search their cards for the matching cell. Chips can display images while cards show words or vice versa for added learning challenge.',

        id: '8',
        question: 'Can Picture Bingo Teach Sight Words?',
