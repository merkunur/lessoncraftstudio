## Introduction: Closing the School Year Meaningfully

**Last weeks of school challenge**: Students checked out, behavior issues, wasted time

**Research** (McCombs & Pope, 1994): Structured reflection improves retention **35%** (reviewing solidifies learning)

**Traditional end-of-year**: Movies, parties, no academic work
```
Reality:
- 2 weeks: Non-academic activities
- Learning loss: Students forget material (summer slide begins early)
- Behavior problems: No structure = chaos
```

**Meaningful alternative**: Reflection + celebration + review
```
Structure:
- Week 1: Review all year's learning (systematic)
- Week 2: Reflection activities + portfolio creation
- Final days: Celebration with academic connection

Result: Learning continues, students leave proud of growth
```
