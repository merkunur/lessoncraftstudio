## Introduction: Forward vs Backward Planning

**Traditional planning** (forward design):
```
Step 1: Choose activities (fun worksheets, hands-on projects)
Step 2: Teach activities
Step 3: Create test at end
Problem: Activities may not align with assessment
Result: Students do activities but don't master objectives
```

**Backward design** (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005):
```
Step 1: Identify desired results (what should students KNOW?)
Step 2: Determine acceptable evidence (how will they SHOW learning?)
Step 3: Plan learning experiences (what activities will GET them there?)
Result: Every activity purposefully builds toward mastery
```

**Research** (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005 - Understanding by Design): Backward design increases student achievement **15-25%** by ensuring alignment between objectives, instruction, and assessment

**Key insight**: Start with END in mind (assessment), work backward to instruction

---

## The 3 Stages of Backward Design

### Stage 1: Identify Desired Results

**Question**: What should students know and be able to do?

**Example unit**: 4th-grade fractions

**Standards** (Common Core):
```
CCSS.MATH.4.NF.A.1: Explain why a fraction a/b is equivalent to (n×a)/(n×b)
CCSS.MATH.4.NF.A.2: Compare two fractions with different numerators and denominators
CCSS.MATH.4.NF.B.3: Understand addition/subtraction of fractions with like denominators
```

**Enduring understandings** (big ideas students retain):
```
1. Fractions represent parts of a whole
2. Multiple fractions can represent the same amount (equivalence)
3. Fractions can be compared by finding common denominators
```

**Essential questions**:
```
1. How can two different fractions be equal?
2. When do we use fractions in real life?
3. How do we know which fraction is larger?
```

---

### Stage 2: Determine Acceptable Evidence (Assessment)

**Question**: How will students demonstrate mastery?

**Final assessment** (designed BEFORE instruction):

**Part 1: Skill demonstration** (20 points)
```
1. Draw a model showing 2/4 = 1/2 (visual proof)
2. Compare 3/5 and 2/3 (show work using common denominators)
3. Add 2/8 + 3/8 (solve with model)
4. List 3 real-life uses of fractions (application)
```

**Part 2: Problem-solving** (10 points)
```
Word problem: "You ate 2/6 of a pizza. Your friend ate 3/9 of the same pizza. Who ate more? Prove your answer."
Rubric:
- 4 points: Correct answer with visual proof
- 3 points: Correct answer, no proof
- 2 points: Incorrect answer, reasonable attempt
- 0-1 points: No work shown
```

**Performance criteria**: 80% accuracy = mastery (24/30 points)

**Now**: Design instruction to ensure students CAN do these tasks

---

### Stage 3: Plan Learning Experiences (Instruction)

**Question**: What activities will prepare students for assessment?

**Week 1: Introduction to fractions**
```
Monday: Pizza fraction models (concrete)
Tuesday: Worksheet - shade fractions (pictorial)
Wednesday: Fraction word search (vocabulary: numerator, denominator, equivalent)
Thursday: Coloring fractions (1/2 red, 1/4 blue)
Friday: Formative assessment (5 problems - check understanding)

Goal: Students can identify and draw fractions
```

**Week 2: Equivalent fractions**
```
Monday: Paper folding (1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8 physically)
Tuesday: Worksheet - equivalent fraction practice (15 problems)
Wednesday: Fraction crossword (vocabulary: equivalent, simplify)
Thursday: Math puzzle (find equivalent fractions in system)
Friday: Formative assessment (5 problems - equivalence only)

Goal: Students understand why 2/4 = 1/2
```

**Week 3: Comparing fractions**
```
Monday: Fraction strips (visual comparison)
Tuesday: Worksheet - compare fractions with common denominators (20 problems)
Wednesday: Worksheet - compare fractions (find common denominators)
Thursday: Word problems (which is larger?)
Friday: Formative assessment (5 problems - comparison)

Goal: Students can compare any two fractions
```

**Week 4: Addition/subtraction**
```
Monday: Adding fractions with models
Tuesday: Worksheet - addition with like denominators (20 problems)
Wednesday: Worksheet - subtraction with like denominators (20 problems)
Thursday: Mixed operations practice
Friday: UNIT TEST (the assessment designed in Stage 2)

Goal: Students can add/subtract fractions, ready for test
```

**Alignment check**: Every activity builds skills needed for final assessment

**Solution**: Explicit alignment check

### Alignment Checklist

**For each worksheet**:
```
☐ Standard(s) addressed: [write standard code]
☐ Objective: Students will [specific, measurable goal]
☐ Success criteria: [how to know if mastered]
☐ Connection to assessment: [which test question does this prepare for?]
```

**Example**:
```
Worksheet: Comparing fractions (20 problems)

☐ Standard: CCSS.MATH.4.NF.A.2 (Compare fractions)
☐ Objective: Students will compare two fractions with different denominators using common denominators with 80% accuracy
☐ Success criteria: 16/20 problems correct
☐ Connection to assessment: Unit test question #7-10 require fraction comparison

Alignment verified ✓

## Assessment-Driven Instruction

**Principle**: Work samples should look like assessment

**Traditional mismatch**:
```
Practice: Open-ended worksheets (write answer)
Assessment: Multiple choice test (bubble answers)
Result: Format shock on test day (cognitive load wasted)
```

**Aligned practice**:
```
Practice: Same format as assessment
Example: If test is multiple choice, practice with multiple choice
Result: Format familiarity (cognitive load focused on content)
```

---

## Pacing Guide Development

**Pacing guide**: Timeline for covering standards

**Purpose**: Ensure finishing curriculum before end of year

### Creating a Pacing Guide

**Step 1: Count instructional days**
```
School year: 180 days
- Holidays/breaks: 20 days
- Testing days: 10 days
- Assemblies/field trips: 10 days
- Buffer days (sick, snow): 10 days
Actual instructional days: 130 days
```

**Step 2: Allocate days to standards**
```
Grade 4 math: 30 standards
130 days ÷ 30 standards = 4.3 days per standard (average)

Adjust by complexity:
- Simple standards (rounding): 2 days
- Complex standards (fraction operations): 8 days
```

**Step 3: Create weekly schedule**
```
Week 1 (Aug 15-19): Place value & rounding (Standard 4.NBT.A.1-2)
Week 2 (Aug 22-26): Multi-digit addition (Standard 4.NBT.B.4)
Week 3 (Aug 29-Sep 2): Multi-digit subtraction (Standard 4.NBT.B.4)
...

Result: Every standard has dedicated time
```

**Generator benefit**: Quickly create materials for each standard
```
Week 2 focus: Multi-digit addition
Generate: 5 addition worksheets (3.5 minutes)
Print: 30 copies each (handled by printer)
Ready: Week 2 materials complete
```

## Differentiation in Backward Design

**Challenge**: Not all students reach mastery at same rate

**Solution**: Tiered objectives

### Tiered Mastery Levels

**Tier 1: Basic mastery** (80% of students)
```
Objective: Compare fractions with like denominators
Assessment: 3/4 vs 2/4 (which is larger?)
```

**Tier 2: Proficient** (60% of students)
```
Objective: Compare fractions with different denominators
Assessment: 3/4 vs 2/3 (use common denominators)
```

**Tier 3: Advanced** (20% of students)
```
Objective: Compare three or more fractions, explain reasoning
Assessment: Order 2/3, 3/4, 5/6 from least to greatest, justify
```

**Instruction**: Provide materials for all three tiers
```
Monday: All students - Basic comparison (like denominators)
Tuesday: All students - Different denominators introduction
Wednesday: Tier 1 - More practice with like denominators (Station 1)
            Tier 2 - Practice different denominators (Station 2)
            Tier 3 - Advanced multi-fraction comparison (Station 3)
```

**Generator use**: Create 3 levels instantly
```
Level 1 worksheet: Compare fractions (same denominator only)
Level 2 worksheet: Compare fractions (find LCD)
Level 3 worksheet: Order 4+ fractions (complex)

Time: 126 seconds (42 sec each) for all 3 levels
```

## Reflection & Revision Protocol

**After unit completion**: Reflect and improve

### Post-Unit Analysis

**Questions to ask**:
```
1. Did students master objectives? (check assessment data)
   - If yes: Keep unit as-is
   - If no: What needs reteaching?

2. Which activities were most effective?
   - Highest engagement: [list activities]
   - Best learning outcomes: [list activities]
   - Keep these, eliminate ineffective ones

3. Did pacing work?
   - Too rushed: Add 1-2 days next year
   - Too slow: Reduce 1-2 days next year

4. What will I change next year?
   - [specific revisions]
```

**Example reflection**:
```
Unit: Fractions (4 weeks)
Assessment results: 85% mastery (above 80% target) ✓

Most effective activity: Paper folding (Week 2, Monday)
- 100% engagement
- Students said "Aha!" moment
- KEEP THIS

Least effective: Fraction word search (Week 1, Wednesday)
- Students bored (too simple)
- REPLACE with fraction Sudoku (more challenging)

Pacing: Just right (finished Friday as planned)

Next year changes:
- Replace word search with Sudoku
- Add one more formative check in Week 3 (some students still confused on Thursday)
```
