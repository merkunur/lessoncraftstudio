## Security Audit Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization

#### ‚úÖ Already Implemented

- **JWT-based authentication** with device fingerprinting
- **Session management** with active session tracking
- **Admin-only endpoints** protected by `withAdmin()` middleware
- **Single-device login** enforcement with conflict detection

#### üîç Review Required

1. **Token Security**
   - [ ] JWT secret is strong (minimum 256 bits)
   - [ ] Tokens have appropriate expiration (recommendation: 15 minutes access, 7 days refresh)
   - [ ] Refresh tokens are rotated on use
   - [ ] Tokens are properly invalidated on logout
   - [ ] HttpOnly cookies used for token storage (if applicable)

2. **Password Security**
   - [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (minimum 10 rounds)
   - [ ] Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour
   - [ ] Rate limiting on password reset requests
   - [ ] Account lockout after failed login attempts

3. **Admin Access**
   - [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for admin accounts
   - [ ] Admin actions are logged
   - [ ] Admin access is reviewed quarterly
   - [ ] Least privilege principle applied

**File to Review:** `lib/auth-server.ts`, `lib/auth.ts`

---

### API Endpoint Security

#### Payment Endpoints

**Critical Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/stripe/checkout`
- `POST /api/stripe/subscription/upgrade`
- `POST /api/stripe/subscription/downgrade`
- `POST /api/stripe/refund`
- `POST /api/stripe/webhook`

#### Security Requirements

1. **Input Validation**
   ```typescript
   // All inputs must be validated with Zod schemas
   import { z } from 'zod';

   const checkoutSchema = z.object({
     tier: z.enum(['core', 'full']),
     interval: z.enum(['monthly', 'yearly']),
     taxLocationId: z.string().optional(),
   });
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting on all payment endpoints
   - [ ] Recommendation: 10 requests per minute per user
   - [ ] Use Redis or similar for distributed rate limiting

3. **CSRF Protection**
   - [ ] Verify requests come from your domain
   - [ ] Check Origin and Referer headers
   - [ ] Use SameSite cookies

4. **Webhook Security**
   - [x] **CRITICAL:** Stripe webhook signature verification
   - [ ] Idempotency checks to prevent duplicate processing
   - [ ] Replay attack prevention (timestamp validation)

   ```typescript
   // Already implemented in webhook handler
   const signature = req.headers['stripe-signature'];
   const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
     body,
     signature,
     process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   );
   ```

**Files to Review:**
- `app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`
- `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
- `app/api/stripe/refund/route.ts`

---

### Admin Dashboard Security

#### Access Control

1. **Admin Verification**
   ```typescript
   // Every admin endpoint must use withAdmin wrapper
   export const GET = withAdmin(async (req: NextRequest) => {
     // Admin-only logic
   });
   ```

2. **Data Filtering**
   - [ ] Admin can only access data they're authorized for
   - [ ] PII is masked unless explicitly needed
   - [ ] Export functionality includes audit trail

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - [ ] Admin API endpoints have strict CORS policies
   - [ ] Only allow requests from your domain

**Files to Review:**
- `app/api/admin/billing/*/route.ts`
- `lib/auth-server.ts`

---

### Database Security

#### Query Safety

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - [x] Using Prisma ORM (prevents SQL injection)
   - [ ] Review raw SQL queries (if any)
   - [ ] Parameterized queries only

2. **Data Access**
   - [ ] Use Prisma field selection to limit data exposure
   - [ ] Never return sensitive data unless required
   - [ ] Use database-level encryption for sensitive fields

3. **Connection Security**
   - [ ] Database uses SSL/TLS connections
   - [ ] Connection string stored in environment variables
   - [ ] Database user has minimal required permissions

**File to Review:** `lib/prisma.ts`

---

### Sensitive Data Handling

#### Payment Card Data - PCI DSS Compliance

**‚úÖ Compliant Approach (Current Implementation):**
- **Never store card numbers** - Stripe handles all card data
- Use Stripe Elements or Stripe Checkout
- Only store Stripe tokens and payment method IDs

**‚ùå Never Do:**
- Store full card numbers
- Store CVV codes
- Store unencrypted cardholder data

#### Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

**Data Classification:**

| Data Type | Sensitivity | Storage | Encryption |
|-----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Email | High | Database | At rest |
| Name | Medium | Database | At rest |
| Payment history | High | Database | At rest |
| Session tokens | Critical | Database | At rest + in transit |
| Stripe IDs | Medium | Database | At rest |

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Encryption at rest enabled on database
- [ ] TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- [ ] PII access is logged
- [ ] PII is masked in logs and error messages

---

## GDPR Compliance Requirements

### Right to Access (Article 15)

**Implementation Required:**

```typescript
// app/api/gdpr/data-export/route.ts
export async function getUserData(userId: string) {
  return {
    personalInfo: await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } }),
    subscriptions: await prisma.subscription.findMany({ where: { userId } }),
    payments: await prisma.payment.findMany({ where: { userId } }),
    activityLog: await prisma.activityLog.findMany({ where: { userId } }),
    sessions: await prisma.session.findMany({ where: { userId } }),
  };
}
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Create `/api/gdpr/export` endpoint
- [ ] User can download all their data in JSON format
- [ ] Response time: within 30 days (GDPR requirement)
- [ ] Include all data categories

---

### Right to Erasure (Article 17)

**Implementation Required:**

```typescript

export async function deleteUserData(userId: string) {
  // 1. Cancel active subscriptions
  await stripe.subscriptions.cancel(stripeSubscriptionId);

  // 2. Delete user data (with cascade)
  await prisma.user.delete({ where: { id: userId } });

  // 3. Anonymize required data (for legal/accounting)
  await prisma.payment.updateMany({
    where: { userId },
    data: {
      userId: 'DELETED_USER',
      // Preserve transaction data for tax records
    },
  });

  // 4. Request Stripe data deletion
  await stripe.customers.del(stripeCustomerId);
}
