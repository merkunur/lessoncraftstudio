### Language Style Notes

- Maintains professional tone for interface elements
- Natural, flowing Danish that doesn't feel translated
- Appropriate register for folkeskole context

### Unique Danish Features

- **"Hj√¶lpefelter"** - Natural compound for clue/helper cells
- **"Ingen (Tilf√¶ldig)"** - Clear indication of random placement
- **"Ramme"** - Natural choice for decorative borders

### Danish Educational Terminology
- Grid method widely used in Danish art education
- "Arbejdsark" is the standard term for worksheets
- "Opret" (Create) preferred over "Generer" (Generate) for action button
- "Billedbibliotek" follows Danish compound word structure
- Aligns with F√¶lles M√•l curriculum for billedkunst

### Special Considerations
- Danish often uses compound words (gittertegning, hj√¶lpefelter)
- Uses "vandret" (horizontal) and "lodret" (vertical) consistently
- "Gennemsigtighed" for opacity/transparency is the technical term
- Danish educational software typically uses informal address

### Direction Terminology
- **"Vandret"** - Horizontal (literally "water-right")
- **"Lodret"** - Vertical (literally "plumb-right")
- These are standard Danish directional terms used in educational contexts
