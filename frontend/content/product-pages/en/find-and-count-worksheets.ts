Click the theme dropdown to see all available options. The animals theme works perfectly for beginning kindergarten worksheets. Each theme contains dozens of related images organized alphabetically. All images feature bright colors and child-friendly illustrations.

Search for specific objects using the search box. Type any keyword to find matching images across all themes. The search works in all 11 supported languages. Results appear instantly as you type. Click any image thumbnail to select it as a hidden object. Selected images display a blue border to confirm your choice. You can select between 1 and 4 hidden objects total.

Columns range from 5 to 10 as well. A 6×6 grid creates 36 total cells to fill. Larger grids make worksheets more challenging for students. Smaller grids work better for kindergarten worksheets introducing the activity.

Choose your page size from the dropdown menu. Letter portrait (8.5×11 inches) works for most classroom printers. A4 portrait fits European standard paper sizes. Landscape orientations provide wider worksheet layouts. Square formats create unique visual designs. Custom dimensions let you specify exact pixel measurements. The page size affects how large grid images appear. Math worksheets typically use letter portrait for consistent formatting.

Select background colors or decorative themes if desired. Click the page color picker to choose a solid background. Browse background themes for patterned or illustrated backgrounds. Adjust background opacity using the slider control. Border themes add decorative frames around worksheet edges. Border opacity controls how prominent the frame appears. Free printable worksheets look professional with subtle background colors.

Assign task types to each selected hidden object. Each object needs a circle, square, cross out, or count task. Click the dropdown next to each object's thumbnail. Select which action students should perform when finding that object. Circle tasks involve drawing circles around objects. Square tasks require drawing rectangular boxes. Cross out tasks mean drawing X marks. Count tasks ask students to write the total number found.

Mix different task types for varied skill practice. Use circle and square tasks for fine motor development. Add cross out tasks for hand-eye coordination. Include count tasks for math worksheet number practice. The variety keeps kindergarten worksheets engaging for multiple uses. Change task assignments anytime before generating the worksheet.`,
