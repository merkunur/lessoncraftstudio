        description: 'Start by selecting the prepositions you want to teach. Check boxes next to spatial concepts like in, under, behind, or between. Choose all eight prepositions for comprehensive practice or select specific ones for targeted instruction. This flexibility lets you create kindergarten worksheets that match your lesson plans exactly. Next, choose your exercise mode. Fill-in-the-blank format works well for first grade students who can write independently. Multiple choice format suits younger kindergarten students or ESL learners. Both formats teach spatial concepts effectively. The exercise mode determines your worksheet layout just like choosing formats for math worksheets or sight words worksheets. Select how many exercises appear on each worksheet. Choose from one to eight exercises per page. More exercises create comprehensive practice sheets. Fewer exercises work better for struggling students or assessment situations. Adjust the count based on student needs just as you would for phonics worksheets or alphabet worksheets. Decide whether to include name and date fields. Check this option to add student information areas at the top of worksheets. Leave unchecked for generic worksheets you can photocopy multiple times. This small detail makes distributing kindergarten worksheets more organized.',

This works perfectly when you want to control exactly which objects appear. Select animals for a zoo theme unit. Choose food items for nutrition lessons. Pick classroom objects for familiar vocabulary practice. Browse themed categories to find appropriate images quickly. Themes include animals, vehicles, food, toys, nature, and many more. Each theme contains dozens of child-friendly illustrations. Click on images to select them for your kindergarten worksheets. A counter shows how many items you have selected. You need at least as many images as exercises. The search function helps find specific items fast. Type any object name to see matching images instantly. Search for ball, cat, tree, or any other common noun. This feature saves time when creating thematic free printable worksheets that connect to your curriculum. Create worksheets that complement your math worksheets, sight words worksheets, or other materials. Alternatively, select all themes mode for random variety. The generator chooses items automatically from the entire library. This creates unpredictable worksheets where students cannot memorize answers. Random selection works well for practice and assessment situations. Upload custom images to personalize worksheets further. Click upload and select multiple image files at once. Add photos of classroom objects, student artwork, or items from your school environment. Custom images make kindergarten worksheets more relevant and engaging for your specific students.',

          id: '15',
          question: 'Can I use the same images across multiple preposition exercises?',
